The old woman’s shoulders
were dry, unfleshed,
with outstanding veins;
her low belly
was like a lily pad.
When people said
her son had taken fright,
had turned his back on battle
and died,

and shouted,
” If he really broke down
in the thick of strife,
I’ll slash these breasts
that gave him suck,”
and went there
sword in hand.
Turning over body after fallen body,</description>
