      <description>00 Intro2.1 In the last stanza of the preceding decad, the Āḻvār who had already conjured up the vision of the Lord as having entered his body and gone right up to his head, referred to the Lord as the blue gem, overlord of the Celestials and a very attractive jewel, by himself. Each one of these features of the Lord was so fascinating that the Āḻvār could not resist the immediate urge to enjoy them outwardly.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.2 In the last decad, the Āḻvār was confined to the bottom-most depth of dejection and his yearning for the Lord baffled description. It was but meet that the Lord came and presented Himself before such an ardent devotee and saved him from collapsing altogether. It goes without saying that, when the Āḻvār came, face to face, with the Lord, all his erstwhile dejection and the resultant fatigue vanished altogether.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.3 In the first decad of this centum, we saw the Āḻvār in dire distress. Towards the end, the Lord, however, deigned to present Himself and once again, the Āḻvār is in rapturous rapport with the Lord. In this decad, he gives vent to the joy of reunion with the enchanting Lord. In strict sequence, this should have been the second decad instead of being the third. The Āḻvār’s immediate reaction, on seeing the Lord come back to him, was, however, that one of such super eminence, the overlord of the Celestials, should have at all deigned to mingle with one so low.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.4 In the penultimate song of the last decad the Āḻvār expressed his desire to sing profusely the glory of the Lord in a chorus. Looking around, he, however, found the prospect of mustering persons from the rank and file of the worldlings for this purpose pretty bleak. He had, therefore, no option but to shift the venue of his enjoyment to the high Heavens and sing the Lord’s praise in the company of the ‘Nitya Sūrīs’ there.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.5 The sufferings undergone by the Āḻvār, as set out in the last decad, are comparable to the titanic struggle of Gajendra, the elephant, with the crocodile. Even as the Lord rushed, with an aching heart, to the pond post-haste on hearing the alarum raised by the elephant the Lord felt exceedingly remorseful that He did not rush to meet the Āḻvār as soon as the latter became critical of His nonchalance, that is, His not rushing to his aid despite His having the mighty Garuḍa to carry Him anywhere at supersonic speed.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.6 As set out, in the last decad, the Āḻvār is experiencing the Supreme bliss of Union with the Lord, like Heaven transplanted right here. And what about the Lord? In the supreme joy of His union with the Āḻvār, the Lord, is exploring new avenues of regaling him as well as those associated with him. What a fine reciprocity?
In II-3, the Āḻvār pined, for the company of the Lord’s devotees and now the Lord’s love for the Āḻvār extends to his devotees as well.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.7 In the seventh stanza of the last decad, the Āḻvār had mentioned that the Lord’s benevolent grace did not stop with him alone but overflowed its continents and extended to all those connected with him in the preceding and succeeding generations as well. Overwhelmed by this extraordinary benevolence of the Lord the Āḻvār expatiates on it in this decad.
Of the numerous auspicious traits of the Lord extension of His love and care not only to His devotees but all those associated with them, is indeed exemplary.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.8 In the last decad, the Āḻvār was overwhelmed by the Lord’s extraordinary benevolence which did not stop with him aloṇe but overflowed its continents and extended to those connected with him, seven generations, back and forth. In other words, the heavenly bliss enjoyed by the ‘Nityās’ in Heaven could be shared by him and his associates, right here. In his boundless compassion for the suffering humanity, caught up in the vortex of worldly life and sensual pleasures, the Āḻvār would naturally like to seize this golden opportunity and get the area of benevolence extended, by getting the ‘Samsārīs’ (worldlings) also associated with him as fellow-devotees.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.9 This decad pinpoints the concept of ‘Puriṣārtha’ the ultimate value of the final goal of every individual. In the preceding decad, frequent references were made by the Āḻvār to the Eternal Land of absolute bliss. On hearing these, the Lord thought He would rather put the Āḻvār in Heaven if that was all His desire and accordingly told him, “Well, you can have the Mokṣa, as desired”, It is now and here that the position gets crystallised.</description>

      <description>00 Intro2.10 In the last decad, the Āḻvār stressed the need for quick action on the part of the Lord, while praying that He should take service from him, at all times. The Āḻvār’s agitation for expeditious result was, however, construed by the Lord as the Āḻvār’s desire to serve in this body itself and He, therefore, directed the Āḻvār to serve Him in His Iconic Form in Tirumāliruñcōlai malai (very near to Maturai in the South), a nice, quiet place, abounding in lovely hills and beautiful orchards.</description>
