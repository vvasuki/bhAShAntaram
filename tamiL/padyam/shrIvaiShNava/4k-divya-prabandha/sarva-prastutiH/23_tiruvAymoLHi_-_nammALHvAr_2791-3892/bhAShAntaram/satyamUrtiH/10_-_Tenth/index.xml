      <description>00 Intro10.1 The declaration, made by the Saint in the preceding decad, that the Lord is the great Benefactor Who would grant ‘Mokṣa’ (eternal emancipation) when this body of ours falls off, is with reference to the clear assurance given to him by the Lord, to this effect. What looked earlier like an indefinite prospect has now acquired a concrete shape, time-bound, the farthest limit being the fall of the body at the end of the current span of life.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.2 In this decad, the Āḻvār lauds the glory of the Lord, in His worshippable form at Tiruvaṉantapuram (in Kerala State). As we go on, we will find the Āḻvār calling successively at the holy centres of Tiruvāṭṭāṟu, Tirumāliruñcōlai, Tiruppēr and adoring the Lord enshrined in those places. A similar treatment is noticeable in the case of Tirumaṅkai Āḻvār also. He is found calling on the Lords of many holy places, all of them in a single decad of the tenth Centum (X-l) of his grand apocalypse (Periya Tirumoḻi).</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.3 The Āḻvār, who longed, in the preceding song, for the felicity of divine service unto the Lord at Tiru-Aṉantapuram, accompanied by the pious band of Śrī Vaiṣṇavas, was struck down by a deep sense of frustration, when his aspiration did not materialise. So deep was his frustration indeed, that it led him to suspect the frightful possibility of the Lord perpetuating his bondage and prolonging his stay in this abode.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.4 In the preceding decad, the Āḻvār suffered the pangs of separation from the Lord, akin to those experienced by the Gopīs, even when the Lord was in their midst. Just as the Gopīs were placated by Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Āḻvār was pacified by the Lord and his fears were quelled when the Lord assured him that He would no longer get parted from him. Rid of the fear of prolongation of his bondage, the Āḻvār is now jubilant over the near prospect of his ascent to the Lord’s feet in Heaven.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.5 It was out of deep compassion of unique dimensions that Saint Nammāḻvār did, in the midst of his mystic experience, par excellence, turn his attention on the people around, from time to time, in order to turn them God-ward. No doubt, he found them distressingly unresponsive and at one stage (vide stanza 25 of “Periya Tiruvantāti”, the third of Nammāḻvār’s four hymnals), he observed that it would be next to impossible to wean away the worldlings, the incorrigibles and make them God-bent.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.6 As the great Nampiḷḷai would put it, in his inimitable diction, the stage has now been reached when the Lord is in hot pursuit of the Āḻvār. The position hitherto, commencing from the opening song of the Āḻvār’s first hymnal (Tiruviruttam) was, however, just the reverse, that is, the Āḻvār was seeking out the Lord and pursuing Him doggedly. The Āḻvār, who was the supplicant before, is now vigorously sought after by the Lord Whose love for the great savant knows no bounds, vide the 3rd song of this decad, which highlights the speed with which the Lord wishes to take the Āḻvār, to the heavenly abode.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.7 We saw the Āḻvār bursting with joy in the last decad. The Lord, Who stuck fast to the Āḻvār’s heart, would now want to get hold of the Āḻvār’s entire physical frame, limb by limb, like unto the flies swarming, in and around the jack-fruit. Well, what is the Lord’s fascination for this elemental body, which the gnostics (Jñānis) have no hesitation in condemning as foul and are ready to give up, any moment?</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.8 In the sixth decad of this centum, the Lord was indeed in great hurry to take the Āḻvār to Heaven but His speed got somewhat arrested, in the last decad, due to His passionate love for the Āḻvār’s physical frame as well and His resultant desire to lift him up bodily to Heaven. The Āḻvār had to do quite a bit of talking and impress upon the Lord, the non-feasibility of his ascent to Heaven, in this physical body and ultimately the Lord had to yield.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.9 In the last decad, the Āḻvār had put the Lord, a very inconvenient question and thereby put Him in quite an embarrassing predicament. Shorn of all quibblings, the Lord would have had to say, in reply, that it was in the exercise of His unbridled independence that He had kept the Āḻvār, deep down in the mire of Saṃsāra for ages, and now, invoking the self-same trait of His, He has been pleased to extend all the favours, currently enjoyed by the Āḻvār.</description>

      <description>00 Intro10.10 It was indeed a rude jolt to the Āḻvār, who was shocked into a sense of stark reality, when he opened his eyes and found that he was still seated where he was, namely, the hollow inside the trunk of the tamarind tree, in the precincts of Lord Ādinātha’s temple in Āḻvār Tirunakari. It now transpired to him that his ascent to heaven, through the exhilarating ‘Arcirādi mārga’, the honours lavished on him by the various agencies all along the route and at the destination, his stay in the midst of the ‘Nityās’ and ‘Muktās’ in the gem-set hall, where the Lord and His Divine Consort were holding Durbar, all these, expatiated on by him in the preceding decad, were but the figments of his imagination, a mere mental comprehension and nothing more.</description>
