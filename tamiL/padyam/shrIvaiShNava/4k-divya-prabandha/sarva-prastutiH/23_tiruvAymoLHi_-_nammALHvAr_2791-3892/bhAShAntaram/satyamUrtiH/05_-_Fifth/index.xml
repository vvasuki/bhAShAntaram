      <description>00 Intro5.1 Through his brilliant exposition of the Lord’s Supremacy, in the last decad, the Āḻvār could wean away the worldlings from propitiating the minor deities and turn their attention to the Supreme Lord (Viṣṇu). The Āḻvār is about to sing the song of benediction for the new state of affairs to flourish in all its glory, vide V-2. Meanwhile, he draws the searchlight inwards to examine the root-cause of the extraordinary grace showered on him by the Lord, whereby he could not merely stand apart from the worldlings without wallowing as one of them, but also advise and correct them.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.2 In IV-10, the Āḻvār preached to the world at large the Supremacy of Lord Viṣṇu, in convincing style and thereby weaned the people from propitiating minor deities. The resultant upsurge of devotion to the Supreme Lord converted this abode into a land of bliss, hardly distinguishable from Heaven. This again resulted in a free flow of visitors from Heaven and other upper regions to this land, to behold and admire this new state of affairs.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.3 The Āḻvār now reverts to the state that obtained in IV-8 and is all agog to get united with the Lord. Non-fulfilment of his intense longing, however, induces him to contemplate the drastic step of coming into the open and carrying his tale of woe to the public at large so that the unresponsive Lord could be arraigned at the bar of public opinion and the union with Him got accelerated.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.4 In order to put through the proceedings contemplated by the Nāyakī in the preceding decad, she has to first of all draw a sketch of her lover (the accused) for public exhibition and arraignment. But it is pitch dark and she can’t draw the picture. It seems as if the Lord is afraid of being exposed by the Nāyakī and has deliberately induced darkness of such intensity, The whole world is fast asleep, and she has no company.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.5 In the last decad, the Āḻvār felt miserably handicapped by darkness and dew, the inner meaning whereof is that this land of nescience is enveloped in ‘tamas’ or darkness. The Nāyakī’s irresistible urge for the speedy attainment of the Lord, witnessed in V-3 (Mācu aṟu cōti), violently disturbed her firm conviction in the Lord as the Sole Means for attaining Him and made her contemplate the devious indulgence in self—effort, such as embarking on the technique of ‘maṭal’.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.6 The Mother finds Parāṅkuśa Nāyakī, seated like a discourser, with the fingers in an instructional pose and declaring that it is she that created the whole world, that she would become the world herself and so on. The bewildered mother, when queried by her kinsmen says that the Nāyakī is perhaps possessed by the Supreme Lord who is the Inner Self of all beings. Every song in this decad is in two distinct parts, namely, the narration of the Nāyakī’s God-vision (man identified with God), followed by the Mother&amp;rsquo;s suggestion that it is perhaps God who has taken possession of the Nāyakī, that speaks through her.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.7 For the nonce, the Āḻvār attempted to sustain himself by impersonating the Lord, even as the damsels of Vṛndāvan did, during that oppressive break in the middle of the rapturous ‘Rāsa Krīḍā’. But there, Lord Kṛṣṇa reappeared in an even more enchanting form than in the earlier session. But here, the Lord is still keeping Himself away from the Āḻvār, although, on the previous occasions, He obliged the Āḻvār with His appearance, mental vision of course, whenever the Āḻvār’s longing for such communion was far too intense.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.8 Despite the Āḻvār’s intense longing for communion with the Lord enshrined in Vāṉamāmalai, at whose feet he fell like an uprooted tree and sought refuge, he was not favoured with the Lord’s presence. The Āḻvār now turns his attention to the Lord gracing Tirukkuṭantai (Kumbakonam in Tamiḻnādu), hoping that He might be intending to grant him audience at that centre. The Āḻvār is contemplating with all the fervour at his command, the enchanting prospect of the Lord casting His sweet glances at him, conversing with him and gathering him up to His bosom, in sweet embrace.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.9 A frustrated Āḻvār turns his attention on yet another pilgrim centre, named Tiruvallavāḻ (in Kerala), the coveted communion with the Lord at Tirukkuṭantai not having materialised. Even so, he couldn’t get there, being obsessed with the fragrance wafted across from there along with the breeze, the musical drone of the bees humming in the orchards over there, the vedic chantings etc. Thus stranded, en route, the Āḻvār assumes the state of Nāyakī who speaks out her infatuation to her mates.</description>

      <description>00 Intro5.10 Unable to reach the holy place of Tiruvallavāḻ, the Āḻvār contemplated the Lord enshrined there, from the outskirts of the holy city, as we saw in the last decad. The Saint thought, he would sustain himself by meditating on Lord Govinda’s (Kṛṣṇa’s) auspicious traits but it made him thaw down. And so, he prays unto the Lord in this decad to grant him at least the stamina to contemplate His glory and sustain himself, even if He would not oblige him with His company.</description>
