      <description>I was born with sorrow. I withered and suffered in life. When I was young my only wish was to love women and be with them. I searched for a way to escape from my desire for women and wandered everywhere. I searched for the feeling that would lead me to the highest state and found the name “Nārāyaṇa.”
I thought of the round breasts of women and melted to embrace them.</description>

O heart! Let us go to Thirupprithi and worship him.
The lord who, as Rama, built a bridge with the help of the monkeys with large stones over the roaring ocean and went to magnificent Lanka and dashed it to pieces stays in Thirupprithi in the Himalayas where lions with sharp sword-like teeth living in caves wander out and attack strong angry elephants as large as mountains.</description>

      <description>When you become old, you will need to walk holding a stick. Your legs will be so weak you can only walk very slowly, looking down at the ground. O heart! Before old age comes to us, let us go to the temple at Thiruvadari and worship him who killed Putanā when she came to him disguised as a mother to cheat and kill him.
When you become old, your back will be bent and you will need a stick to walk.</description>

      <description>O heart! With only his bow and arrows as his help, he crossed the forests where deer, elephants and horses wandered, built a bridge with stones over the wave-filled ocean, went to Lanka, fought the heroic Rāksasas and, defeating them, cut off the ten heads of Rāvaṇa, the Rākshasa king of Lanka surrounded with oceans and forts. Let us go to beautiful Sāḷakkirāmam where he stays and worship him.</description>

      <description>Before in my life, I wanted only to enjoy the small foreheads, round arms, beautiful breasts and shining moon-like smiles of lovely women. I understand now that I was weak and what I did was wrong. I am ashamed that I wanted to be with young women. I know this birth is a sickness and I do not want to be born again. O my father! You stay in Naimeesāraṇyam.</description>

      <description>I thought that my mother, father, wife and relatives were important. I suffered, became your slave, and like a dog I have come longing to see you in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills where you stay surrounded with fragrant groves with blooming flowers and thick round bamboo plants. You are my refuge. Give me your grace and protect me.
Intoxicated, I fell in love with beautiful women with lovely doe-like eyes and I have committed many sins in this large world that will only lead me to hell.</description>

Become his slave now.
O heart, the god of dharma who has no relatives or family and who destroys the future births of his devotees on this earth stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills where gypsy girls and bees sing kurinji songs together.</description>

      <description>When the Rākshasa king of Lanka came as a sage in orange clothes and took Sita the wife of Rama to Lanka, our Nambi went to Lanka, fought with its king, destroyed it and brought his wife Sita back. The beautiful cowherd women with round bamboo-like arms scolded him saying, “You stole our butter and ate it. You are a thief.” He rests on a snake bed on the ocean in Thiruyevvuḷ.</description>

      <description>Our lord who stays with Lakshmi and the cowherd’s daughter Nappinnai, loving them, stands in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with flourishing water and thick groves, sits in Thiruvāli, reclines in Thirukkuḍantai and dances in Thirukkovalnahar flourishing with ponds. He does not show any compassion to the Rākshasas and stays in Thiruneermalai hills.
The lord grew angry at Indra and burned Kāṇḍavanam when Indra stayed there. He fought in the Bharatha war and saved the world from affliction, and when he became angry with Hiraṇyan, he took the form of a man-lion and split open the Asuran’s chest.</description>

      <description>In Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam I saw the lord, strong as a bull, sweet as the nectar from the milky ocean, generous as the Karpaga tree, bright like a golden hill, sweet as sugarcane in the hearts of his devotees, precious as a coral pillar, who swallowed all the worlds and spit them out, split open the mouth of the Asuran that came as a horse, broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam and walked between the marudam trees and broke them and who saved Gajendra from the crocodile.</description>

      <description>I will not spend even the time it takes to blink thinking of those who do not think of my god who took the form of Mohini and gave to the gods the nectar that came from the milky ocean, cheating the sword-carrying Asurans, the enemies of the gods. He stays in beautiful cool Kaḍalmallai Thalasayanam surrounded by the large ocean.
Those devotees who think in their hearts and worship the cloud-colored lord of Kaḍalmallaithalasayanam who keeps beautiful Lakshmi on his chest seated on a fresh lotus dripping with dew and at his side the earth goddess are my chiefs and my rulers.</description>

      <description>Her mother says, “Even though my daughter with a lovely face as beautiful as the white shining moon knows that Lakshmi born in the milky ocean with its nectar stays on your chest, she does not stop loving you. She is as beautiful as the doll in the kolli hills and her lovely eyes are like kuvalai blossoms. She loves to worship your feet.

      <description>She asked her neighbors, “The sound of worship of the people in the three worlds was like the roaring waves of the ocean when he came as a man-lion with sharp teeth and red hair shining like fire and split open the chest of the Asuran Hiranyan while Shiva, burner of the three forts, and Nānmuhan on the lotus saw and worshiped him. Who is he? Tell me.” They replied, “He told us he is from Aṭṭapuyaharam.</description>

      <description>Our dear lord who ate the butter that the cowherd women gave him, slept on a banyan leaf at the end of the eon, drank the milk of the devil Putanā, broke the two marudu trees, and who measured the world and the sky with his two feet at king Mahabali’s sacrifice, stays in the temple in Thiruveḷḷiyanguḍi in the southern land where the Maṇṇi river flows among the groves with its abundant water and coconut, banana and tall kamugu trees grow.</description>

      <description>The lord who is a dancer, my ruler and the ruler of the whole world, is hard for anyone to know. The lord who went to Mahābali as a dwarf and measured the world and the sky stays happily in beautiful Puḷḷambudanguḍi where surumbu bees swarm around the fragrant flowers, beautiful peacocks dance and bees with lined wings sing.
Our faultless lord, the sweet thief who went as a dwarf to the king Mahabali, cheated him and took the earth and sky and who saved the long-trunked elephant Gajendra when it was caught by a crocodile stays happily in beautiful Puḷḷambudanguḍi where birds searching for food for their nestlings fly to the fertile fields to catch the frolicking kāyal fish.</description>

      <description>Kudalur where beautiful girls with fingers as lovely as kāndal buds wear soft dresses and spread the fragrance from their hair everywhere is the place of the god who does not know his own greatness and went as a messenger for the Pandavas.
Kuḍalur where bees drink sweet fragrant honey and sing kurinji songs is the place of the beautiful god who fought with the seven humped bulls and married Nappinnai, the daughter of a fisherman.</description>

      <description>O divine lord who came as Parasuraman carrying a mazhu and conquered many kings for twenty-seven generations, you stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai where fragrant breezes enter the mango groves and the mandrams and make the jasmine and mullai bloom. Give me your grace and show me a way to reach and worship your ankleted feet .
You who, taking the form of a horse, brought the Vedas and taught them to the sages when Nānmuhan, seated on a lotus had lost them stay in Thiruveḷḷaṛai where a breeze blows though the tall Madhavi trees and spreads fragrance through all the streets and in the groves and in all directions.</description>

Our Māyan who swallowed the whole world and slept on a banyan leaf and who rests on the ocean on the snake Adisesha that has diamonds on his thousand heads stays in Thennarangam surrounded by the Kaviri flowing with abundant water mixed with sandal paste that had been smeared on women’s large breasts and with flowers from the garlands that adorned their beautiful hair.</description>

      <description>Her mother says, “My daughter never used to worry about anything. Now she worries always and says ‘O Venkaṭam, O Venkaṭam!’ She refuses to come and lie on my lap. She forgets to sleep closing her long sword-like eyes. What did the beloved of Lakshmi, born in the milky ocean, do to my daughter? The precious god with the beautiful dark color of a bee or a cloud lies on Adisesha on the ocean with rolling waves.</description>

      <description>In Thennarangam surrounded by the beautiful ocean I saw the lord who is as strong as an elephant, a dark emerald that lies on Adisesha on the ocean. He, Thirumaal, my lord who is sweet to me always, taught the Vedas to the sages and protected the cows and the cowherds from the storm.
In Thennarangam I saw Thirumal, the lord of Thirukkuṛunguḍi, Thiruthaṇgā and the good lord of Thirukkarampanur who was still hungry even after he swallowed the dark seven oceans, seven mountains and seven worlds.</description>

      <description>Our dear lord who is the ancient four Vedas, the sacrifice, question, answer and the meaning of all, shining fire, abundant water, earth, cloud, wind, the seven roaring oceans, the seven mountains, the sky and the earth stays in Thiruvarangam.
The dear lord with the countless good qualities of Indra, Nānmuhan and Shiva, our father, mother, children, relatives who will not abandon us, the remedy that removes our desires, the nature of all and the end and life for all creatures stays in Thiruvarangam.</description>

      <description>You did not consider that the boatman Guhan was poor and low-caste, or that he was not your relative, but gave your sweet grace to him and even told him that your wife, the innocent doe-eyed Sita, was his sister-in-law and that your brother Lakshmaṇa was his brother. You told him happily, “You are my friend. Stay here with me.” I heard those words and they stay in my mind.</description>

      <description>The dark colored lord who carries a shining discus and a conch in his hands, is not false but a true god and if you approach him he will accept you as his devotee. I have praised the names of him who rests on Adisesha, the snake bed in Thenthirupperur surrounded by thick groves where beautiful lotuses bloom and I am saved.
I have praised the names of Thirumāl, our father who swallowed the seven oceans, the mountains, the sky and all the beautiful worlds and spat them out, the god of Thenthirupperur surrounded with thick groves that touch the dark clouds and the moon and I am saved.</description>

      <description>Our lord is the faultless earth, fire, wind, water, and the high sky, our faultless mind, sleep and moksha. When he stole butter and his mother Yashoda became angry and hit him, he was not worried. O heart! Think of going to Nandipuraṇṇagaram where our good lord with a broad chest stays.
O heart, there is a way you can be saved— this is what you must do. Think of Nandipuraviṇṇagaram where the lord stays who swallowed the seven worlds at the end of the eon, where dark lined bees drink honey, play in the flowers with their swarm and sing Naivaḷam ragas in the groves.</description>

      <description>O lord, you are my ruler! I came and worshiped you who measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice as devotees and the gods carrying fragrant bunches of flowers swarming with honey-drinking bees and worshiped you so that their karma will be removed. If you give me your grace so I may see you, I will not want this family life, O god of Thiruviṇṇagar.
You are the highest lord. When the milky ocean was churned, you saw Shiva with a forehead eye when he drank the poison that came from the ocean, and you gave the nectar that came out of the milky ocean to the gods and you loved Lakshmi who came from the milky ocean.</description>

      <description>Before I wanted wealth and the pleasures that the five senses gave. Even though I was hurt again and again, I did not stop enjoying those pleasures. I was friendly with people I liked and I hated those I did not like. Now, I have come to understand that those pleasures were evil and I have removed them from my mind. O lord of Thiruviṇṇagar, now I hate the deeds I did and I come to you, my refuge.</description>

I do not love or hate anyone. I left my family and all other relatives and friends and became a good person.</description>

You may fall.” Before that happens, O heart, rise, we will go to Naṛaiyur and worship him who is the sky, the mountains, the Vedas and the sacrifice.
When you grow old, women with lovely hair adorned with flowers dripping honey will join together, laugh and say mockingly, “How could you come to us coughing liked this?</description>

The faultless lord who took the form of a lion that fights fearfully, went to Hiraṇyan and with his sharp claws split open the chest of that enemy Asuran stays in beautiful Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded by groves flourishing with buds that drip honey where cuckoo birds sing and play on the tender red shoots of mango trees.</description>

      <description>O devotees, you join the divine feet of him who swallowed the sky, the vast earth, the eight directions, the wavy ocean and the ancient mountains and rests on the leaf of a branching banyan tree. The Chola king Kochenganan worshiped the lord of Manimādakkoyil in Thirunaṛaiyur where beautiful bees drink honey from shenbaga flowers that spread fragrance and then fly to vakulam flowers and stay there.
O devotees, you stay sweetly under the feet of the lord, our father who took the form of a fish and swam, jumping as high as a mountain, playing joyfully and saving the world when a terrible flood came at the end of the eon.</description>

He stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where heroic men, handsome as Murugan and Kāma, and women with spear-like eyes walk on the streets and the noise of festivals does not stop all day.
The Nambi with a thulasi garland on his chest who took the form of Balaraman, carried a sharp mazhu weapon and killed many crowned kings over many ages stays in Thirunaṛaiyur where mullai flowers dripping with dew bloom like the teeth of women and dark kuvaḷai blossoms bloom like their eyes, and the lovely lotuses bloom like their faces.</description>

      <description>Our Thirumāl took the form of a bachelor wearing a deerskin on his chest, went to king Mahābali, asked for three feet of land and measured the world and the sky with his two feet. I searched for him in Thiruvenkaṭam hills where honey drips on the slopes and I saw him in Thirunaṛaiyur.
Our father, Thirumal, the lord of Thennāli churned the milky ocean, and in ancient times, at the end of the eon, he took the form of a fish and swallowed the ocean.</description>

      <description>O heart, go and reach the feet of the divine one who took away the trouble of Shiva when he wandered through all the three worlds and begged, carrying the skull of Nānmuhan. Our lord stays in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with fields where a handsome male swan, without leaving his mate, opens the petals of a lotus and drinks honey.
O heart, go and reach the feet of the divine god who shot his fire-like arrows and made the ten crowns of the strong ill-famed Rākshasa Rāvaṇa fall.</description>

      <description>Our Nambi who rests on Adisesha on the ocean in Kuḍandai took the form of a boar and split open the earth to bring the earth goddess from the underworld. He destroyed the forts of Lanka and conquered the Rākshasas and he measured the world and the sky with his two feet at Mahabali&amp;rsquo;s sacrifice. Praise his name and say, “Namo Narāyaṇāya.”
The lord jumped into the lotus pond, fought with the snake Kālingan and danced on his head, took the form of a boar and split open the earth and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.</description>

      <description>Like a young calf that craves its mother’s milk I call you unceasingly. You, our Nambi, stay in Naṛaiyur surrounded with groves dripping with honey. Give me your grace so I will not be born again, my father and my god.
Ancient and famous, you swallowed all the oceans that never dry and the seven hills. I have no one—I am your slave. I call you, I come to you.</description>

      <description>When I praise you saying, “You took the form of a swan and a boar. You, a thief, entered my heart,” my eyes fill with tears and my heart melts and thinks of you only. I will not approach anyone but you, O Nambi, god of Naṛaiyur.
As a strong man-lion that never retreats you killed Hiraṇyan. You came to me and entered my heart. I will not sing and praise others with my pāsurams, I will not approach anyone except you, O Nambi, god of Naṛaiyur.</description>

      <description>The learned ones praise him in their minds always saying, “He killed the cruel-eyed Rakshasas with his heroic bow.” The Nambi who destroyed the seven trees cannot be seen by anyone, but I, his slave, I saw him in a dream and I am very happy.
He, adorned with emeralds on his ears, makes me think of him like a calf that thinks of his mother, and he thinks of me and gives his grace to me.</description>

      <description>The cool lotus-eyed Kaṇṇan, the cowherd took the form of a strong fish and saved the world from the storm when the water rose up to the world of the gods at the end of the eon. I am his devotee and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram filled with flourishing fields and forests.
I am the devotee of the wise lord who took the form of a turtle and held Mandara mountain as a stick to churn the milky ocean and then took the nectar from the ocean and distributed it to the gods in the sky when there was a large flood at the end of the eon, and I found him in Thirukkaṇṇapuram surrounded by the roaring ocean.</description>

A cowherdess says, “O dear Yashoda! I got up early and went to sell the churned buttermilk, looking for people to buy it, but I didn’t see anyone except the son of Nandan with hair that was decorated with fragrant flowers.</description>

      <description>A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan, “You didn’t come on the day you said you would to see me, but wearing earrings in your ears and lovely clothes on your waist and a cool tulasi garland shedding its pollen on your chest you come here now and stand behind me. What is this? What is this?”
A cowherd girl says to Kaṇṇan, “You wear an orange dress, your hair is tied up in a knot and you have tied a kachu around your waist.</description>

      <description>Her mother says, “You, the heroic lord, burnt Lanka and you drank the milk of the devil Putana when she came in the middle of the night and killed her. Our young girls decorated with flowers dripping with honey love you, but you ignore their love and don’t care about them— you’re just like the mothers who take away a cup of milk from their children’s hands whenever they want and don’t worry about it.</description>

      <description>She says, “Our divine god protected the cows and cowherds from the storm by carrying Govardhana mountain. Heroic, he fought with the Rākshasas with his victorious bow and defeated them. Does the breeze blow on me as if it were fire because I think of his heroic deeds? What can I do?”
She says, “The cold wind hurts me as the dark clouds pour down drops of rain. Am I being punished because I long to see the chest and the garlands of the dark god colored like a cloud or the ocean?</description>

      <description>She says, “The lord who carried Govardhana mountain as an umbrella and blocked the storm, saving the cows and the cowherds, and who danced the Kuravai dance with young girls in the mandram has enchanted me. The andril bird on the palm tree in the front yard coos and hurts me. Who can remove its nest so it will not coo and call its absent mate?”
She says, “The heroic Kaṇṇan who shattered the blooming Kurundam trees, and broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam fought with the Asuran who came as a horse, took the form of a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan, and drank milk from the devil Putana and killed her.</description>

      <description>She says, “He drove a shining chariot in the Bharatha war and he measured the world in three footsteps at Mahābali’s sacrifice. He fought with the Rākshasas and destroyed the pride of Lanka. See, my conch bangles have grown loose and I have lost my beauty because I love him.
She says, “He stays in my heart. When the elephant Gajendra with huge legs was caught by a crocodile, he came and saved him and gave him his grace.</description>

      <description>When the world was inundated by a terrible flood and the waves of the ocean rose and the water flowed everywhere and people had no place to go, the gods in the sky went to the lord and said, “There is no refuge for us,” and Thirumāl took the form of a fish, carried all the mountains on his back and saved all. Worship him, O my heart, do not forget him.</description>

      <description>O friend, see, he went on a path filled with stones and lived in the forest with his wife Vaidehi with soft doe like eyes.. The gods from the sky bowed with their heads adorned with garlands and worshiped the golden feet of Rama when he walked in the forest. Say sāzhale.
O friend, see! After he was born he released his father Vasudeva from the chains that bound his ankles and Nandan, the cowherd chief, took him as a baby to his village where he was raised as Nandan’s son.</description>

      <description>At the end of the eon, he swallowed all the gods’ worlds and the people of the seven worlds surrounded with dark oceans and he kept them in his divine stomach for a long time. Think about it, O devotees. You worship the gods of other religions who are our enemies. What good did they do for us? Don’t be ungrateful. Worship only our lord in the sky who carries a discus smeared with oil.</description>

      <description>The dear lord whose chest is adorned with jewels shines like a golden hill and rides on the bird Garuḍa. He used Mandara mountain as a churning stick and the snake Vasuki as a rope, churned the milky ocean, took the nectar from it and gave it to the gods. If devotees have not seen him, their eyes are not truly eyes.
The highest lord who is sweet to his devotees shines as a precious jewel that never loses its luster.</description>

      <description>O Nambi, you are smell, taste, touch and sound. When I complain that you have not given me your grace, you may say that I did not do the right things. I will say one thing to you. Do not make me to go into a womb and be born again. I am afraid that I will be like a tree on the bank of a river that may fall at any time.</description>
