  <p>Chanda kali virutham.
Who is God? What is God? What is the nature of God?</p>
<ol start="752">
<li>
<p>You are five things—taste, light, touch, sound and smell in earth.
You are four things—taste, light, feeling of touch, and sound in water.
You are three things—taste, light and heat in fire.
You are two things—the touch and the sound of the wind.
You are the unique ancient one.
You are many things on the earth.
You are the dark-colored one.
Who has the power to know who you are?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the six actions—
learning, teaching, performing sacrifices,
making others perform sacrifices, giving and receiving.
You are worshipped by the fifteen sacrifices.
You are the beautiful two—wisdom and renunciation,
and the three devotions, devotion for god,
the devotion that gives knowledge to know god,
and the highest devotion that gives moksha.
You are the seven and six and eight.
You are many wisdoms,
the true and the false.
You are taste, light, touch, sound and smell.
You, Māyan, are everything on earth
yet who can see you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the chief of the twenty-four philosophies,
the five elements water, land, fire, wind and the sky,
the five sense organs, body, mouth, eyes, nose and ears,
the five organs of action, mouth, legs, hands, the unclean organs,
the five senses, taste, sight, hearing, smell and touch
and the four organs of knowledge,
mind, ego, knowledge, and ignorance.
You who stay in the sky are all these and more.
O Māyan, who can see you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the thirty-three Sanskrit sounds.
You are the five consonants,
and the sixteen vowels.
You are the lord of the five special sounds in Tamil
and the mantra with twelve sounds,
“Om namo bhagavate Vāsudevāya.”
You are the three faultless lights—the sun, the moon and the stars.
You have entered my heart—why, O my lord?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You , the anceint one are everything on the earth,
and the life of all creatures.
No one knows who you are
but you are in everyone and everything,
there is no limit to you.
You created Nanmuhan on your navel
and he creates all creatures of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adisesha carries the earth and you,
the mountains burden the earth,
the sky carries the Ganges and the clouds,
and you contain in yourself water, fire, wind, sky and the earth
and protect them all and all are in you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the Māyan, the cowherd,
the three forms of the gods, Shiva, Vishnu and Nanmuhan,
the sleep, the feelings of all, ,
the two times, night and day,
and the oceans, the earth, the three fires.
You are the great one praised by three-eyed Shiva.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the most ancient of the ancient gods
and you abide across the worlds
and you know the birth of the ancient gods.
Who can tell the time when you became the first one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the pure one.
Shiva with red matted hair
adorned with kondrai garlands that drip pollen
worships your feet as the Vedas say.
The Vediyars who know the Vedas well
and the sages who recite the sacrificial mantras
worship you through the right paths that the sastras prescribe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as the white waves born in the wide ocean
rise and go back into the ocean,
everything that is in the world is born from you,
stays and lives in the world by your grace
and goes back into you. Such is your nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can words even begin to describe you,
who are the sounds that form the words of the Vedas,
the meaning of all the words in the Vedas,
and the light that cannot be described by words.
You created Nanmuhan and he creates
all the creatures of the world by your order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You created the world,
you swallowed, spat it out
and again you created it again.
The world is within you
and you are separate from it also.
You do not remain in one place.
Who knows how you are in this world?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one can say just what or who you are.
Some say that you are the beloved of Nappinnai,
and some say you are only a cowherd
and play with cowherd girls.
Who can know your name, your place,
your birth and what form you will take in the future?
No one can know your nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who are pure yoga and carry in your hands
the Sarngam bow adorned with thulasi garlands
are the ancient one who took the form of a turtle.
You rest on the deep ocean.
We do not know what your name is,
but we say you are the creator of the Samaveda
and the Vedas praise you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the four Vedas, the six Upanishads
and their meaning.
You, the precious one
rest on the wide ocean on many-headed Adishesha.
Aren’t you the one with a white conch and the Sarngam bow?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the souls of the gods,
plants, people who do good and bad karma and animals.
Even though people do not know who you are,
they hear of you from the Vedas and the scriptures of the sages
and they know you in their hearts.
Your greatness is like that of high mountains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are unique,
but you, limitless, are also the three gods,
Shiva, Vishnu and Nānmuhan, and the four gods.
You who rest on Adishesha on the wide ocean
are the source of good karma,
and give joy and goodness to all.
No one can comprehend your form.
How can you, the ancient god,
come to the world in human form?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You rest on the snake bed of Adishesha with a thousand mouths,
and two thousand fiery eyes,
who makes a roof for you and is never apart from you.
You have the color of the ocean—
why do you rest on the ocean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who carry a shining discus
took the form of a swan
and taught the Vedas to the sages,
split open the mouth of the Asuran
when he came as a bird,
and ride on the eagle.
Even though you carry an eagle flag,
why do you love to rest on the ocean on Adisesha,
the snake that is an enemy of the eagle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without being shy,
you rest on a snake on the ocean
and the gods come there and sing and praise you.
O Kesava who took the form of a turtle
that lives in moss-covered water,
why did you do that and allow others to say bad things about you?
Tell us so we can understand you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the lord of Srirangam.
When you churned the ocean of milk
the waves were wild, the water was stirred up,
trees fell and the large earth shook
as the snake Vasuki suffered.
What did the Asuras do?
When you went to Lanka to fight with Ravaṇa,
you were happy to get the help of the monkeys.
You are our father!
Tell us how all that happened so we can understand you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the highest on the earth,
the ancient god adorned with a thulasi garland
that swarms with bees, are the past, present and future.
Taking the form of the child Kaṇṇan,
you swallowed all the seven worlds and slept on a banyan leaf,
you who embrace on your chest the goddess Lakshmi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You took the form of a white lion
and with your claws, split open the chest
of Hiraṇyan with shining teeth.
You, the Padmanabhan, rest on the ocean of milk,
and famous yogis recite the four Vedas and worship you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O marvelous one,
the water of the Ganges flows from your lotus feet
and you carry in your beautiful hands
a discus, a conch, a club, a bow and a sword.
O god of gods who took the form of a man-lion,
the goddess Lakshmi, adorned with beautiful blossoms
dripping with pollen, lives on your chest.
O Māyan, your body has the blue color of the ocean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You took the form of a man-lion,
split open Hiraṇyan’s chest with your claws and killed him
who had received many boons doing hard penance.
You came as a dwarf and begged for land from Mahābali,
but what kind of lie was that, since the world was already yours?
Did you hide the land in your stomach
that you received by begging him?
O Kaṇṇa! Who has the ability to know what you think?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have taken form of a man, Rāma, and a woman, Mohini.
You are what is good and what is evil,
food, sound and smell,
the false and the true,
and you are illusory and appear to be nothing.
You have been a cowherd looking after bulls
and you went to Mahābali as a dwarf and took his land.
You are a thief.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who destroy people’s sins
are the light that shines crossing the sky,
the bright form of wisdom and music.
You went to king Mahābali as a dwarf-sage,
begged for his land,
and measured the earth with one foot,
grew tall and measured the sky with the other.
Who will respect you for how you cheated Mahābali?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the Māyan carrying the discus in your strong hand
created the earth, swallowed the earth and spat it out,
and you created the oceans and slept on a banyan leaf.
When the Asuras Thirumāli and Sumali came to fight with you,
you sent them to Yama’s world,
O you who went as a dwarf and measured the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who are the highest god of the gods
and the form of wisdom rest on the ocean,
keeping Lakshmi on your chest and embracing her.
You came to this earth in human forms.
No one can say what your nature is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who are the sky, earth, hills, and seven oceans
are as lovely as a lotus and you carry a victorious lotus.
You enjoyed the food served for Indra and slept on a banyan leaf,
you shot a stone from your sling and hit Manthara’s hunched back
and you are adorned with a lovely fragrant cool thulasi garland
that drips with pollen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the good lord of unlimited fame
who carry the discus that decides the life of all
were born as a child and swallowed all the seven worlds in ancient times.
As heroic Rāma, you became angry, bent your bow and calmed the ocean.
O Murthi, you give moksha to your devotees
if they worship you in their hearts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your feet are beautiful as lotuses.
You, the ancient one, crossed the ocean with the help of a monkey army,
fought the Raksasas, shot your cruel arrows and destroyed them.
You begged Mahābali to give you land and took all his land,
measuring the earth and the sky with your feet
so they all belonged to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shooting your cruel arrows
you destroyed Ravaṇa whose teeth were as bright as lightning,
and you gave your grace to Vibhishaṇa and the kingdom of Lanka.
You are the beloved of Nappinnai, the innocent woman
with sweet words and a lovely color.
Aren’t you the lotus-eyed god
who have everlasting fame and a golden color?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who are the ancient of the ancients of the world,
the highest of all the lights and the truth
are the Vedas, the sacrifice and the sky and the earth.
What is your magic that you are the ancient one
and a cowherd?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You with a discus who give your love to all,
took the forms of a fish
that swims on the ocean and of a turtle
and you were a child for the cowherd woman Yashoda
with a waist as thin as a vine.
O lord, what is your magic
that you are a cowherd and also our god?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who were raised by the cowherdess Yashoda
with breasts decorated with beautiful ornaments
destroyed Sakaṭāsuran when he came as a cart,
took the life of an Asuran when he came as a bird,
and you drank milk from the breasts of the deceiving devil Putanā.
How could you drink the nectar from the mouths of women
ornamented with golden bracelets on their hands?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You took the forms of a dwarf and a boar
and you made the vilam fruits fall and destroyed the Asurans
You made the blooming kurundam tree fall,
you killed the Asuran Kesi
and you split open the mouth of the Asuran who came as a bird.
People say that you are Kaṇṇan
and that is why you could do all these things with your strong hands.
You drank the milk of the cowherdess Yashoda,
ate mud, you stole butter and ate it,
and you drank the milk of the devil Putanā.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the cloud-colored lord,
our chief, broke the tusks
of the rutting elephant that dripped ichor.
You danced on the snake Kalingan
and you danced the kuthu dance on pots.
You the god with a discus that destroys your enemies,
wear cool thulasi garlands on your chest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the cloud-colored lord,
used Mandara mountain as a churning stick
and churned the milky ocean.
You made a bridge using stones on the ocean to go to Lanka,
and you destroyed Lanka surrounded by stone walls,.
You protected the cows from the storm with Govardhana mountain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You saved the elephant Gajendra from the crocodile
and you killed the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam,
You were raised as a cowherd child, grazed the cows
and protected them from the storm with Govardhana mountain.
You fought with the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai.
What is all this magic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you were a cowherd,
you loved the cowherd girl Nappinnai
with round bamboo-like arms.
O cowherd, who can conquer you?
You, the Māyan, are the sky and the earth.
You destroy illusions yet you create illusions.
Is all your magic an illusion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Shiva was cursed by Nanmuhan
and Nanmuhan’s skull stuck to Shiva’s hand,
you filled the skull of Nanmuhan
with your blood and it fell from Shiva’s hand.
You must not be ashamed to tell about Shiva
with a red body and a crescent moon in his matted hair
where the Ganges flows.
O lord who fought the seven bulls,
you should not be ashamed to tell others about Shiva.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the best of everything,
broke the white tusks of an enraged elephant.
You destroyed Kamsan when he was angry with you.
You are the Māyan who measured the world
and drank the milk of the deceiving devil Putanā and killed her,
you, the ancient god colored as dark as kohl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the sweetness in milk,
the brightness of precious gold,
and the freshness of green moss.
You have the dark color of bees
that drink honey and fly around ponds.
You are the four seasons.
Why does the world not understand the grace of Thirumāl?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you on the earth or are you in the sky,
or are you mixed into the earth?
We do not know who you are—what is this magic?
Are you with other gods in heaven?
Are you near? Are you far?
O virtuous one resting on the snake Adishesha,
who wear a fresh thulasi garland, you are pure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your hair is adorned with a fresh thulasi garland
with beautiful petals.
You carry a conch and a discus
and you ride on lovely-winged Garuḍa.
I have not received your goodness like the other devotees.
I am like a dog. Give me your grace
so I will reach moksha and not be born again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Kaṇṇa, you, the king of the sky,
have the color of a dark cloud.
People say that you are omnipresent and boundless.
You who rest on a snake bed on the ocean,
I am like a dog—I want to know where you are.
I beg you, please tell me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You stay on the hill of Thiruvenkaṭam,
and in the sky with the gods,
and you rest on the wide ocean on Adishesha.
You swallowed the earth,
you took the land from Mahābali and measured it,
and you assumed the form of a boar, split open the earth
and brought forth the earth goddess who was hidden.
You, the ancient god, created all lives
and you gave godliness to the gods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Thirupadi of the god who threw a ball happily
at the hump on the back of Manthara, the servant of Kaikeyi
with hair adorned with flowers swarming with bees,
is Srirangam surrounded by water
where keṇḍai fish swim about, valai fish jump
and cranes swallow crabs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Thiruppadi of the lord
who in ancient times, taking the form of heroic Rāma,
shot arrows from his bow with his strong hands
and made the dark ocean in Lanka with its white waves grow red
is famous Srirangam
surrounded by groves swarming with bees
where the divine water of the Kaviri flows
in all the eight directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Thiruppadi of the lord who bent his bow, shot his arrows
and cut down the ten heads of Ravaṇa the king of Lanka
is Srirangam where the waves of the Kaviri river roll everywhere
bringing gold to the shores
and where Nanmuhan worshipped him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Thiruppadi of the lord
who fought the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam
who came to attack him angrily and broke its tusks
is Srirangam surrounded by clear water
where the Vediyars are without desire
and walk holding bamboo sticks that have small pearls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Thiruppadi of the ancient god Thirumāl
who cut off the thousand arms of Bānasuran
and chased him away from the terrible battlefield
as the three-eyed Shiva and his escorts
who had come to help the Asuran also retreated with their army
is the famous Srirangam surrounded by water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The god who shot sharp arrows and destroyed Lanka,
stays in Srirangam where the Kaviri river
that was born in the summits of mountains
and descends from the hills carries in its rolling waves
fragrant sandal and kungumam paste
as they break and dash on the banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the husband of the everlasting earth goddess
who is as beautiful as a flower,
and you also married the cowherd girl Nappinnai.
You gave me your grace so that I keep your feet in my mind.
You are Puṇḍarigan and you stay in Srirangam
surrounded by the Ponni river.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the heroic god, went to Lanka
and conquered and killed the king Ravaṇa,
making his ten garlanded heads fall to the ground.
You are Thirumāl of Kuḍandai
where wise, faultless Vediyars with sacred threads
recite the Vedas and worship you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He who carries a conch,
embraces beautiful Lakshmi on his chest,
and kills his enemies with his discus
is Puṇḍarigan of Kuḍandai
where young women whose long beautiful hair
is decorated with kongu flowers
play in the cool abundant water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O good Thirumāl,
you killed the Asuras when they came as marudam trees,
you fought and killed the elephant Kuvalayabeeḍam,
destroying its strength,
you split open the mouth of the Asuran Kesi
when he came as a horse,
and you measured the earth with your feet.
You stay in of Kuḍandai,
giving boons to Vediyars skilled in the Vedas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, a hero, bent your bow,
killed the Asurans Vakkaran, Karan and Muran
and sent their heads to Yama.
You, a cowherd, stay in flourishing Kuḍandai
with ponds and blooming groves
and rich fields protected by many fences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O god of Thiruvenkaṭam where cool rain falls abundantly
and bamboo plants grow tall and touch the sky,
aren’t you Thirumāl who rests on the ocean
in Kuḍandai surrounded by cool blooming groves
dripping with honey?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did your feet hurt when you walked with Sita in the forest?
Did your body shake when you took the form of a boar
and dug up the earth and brought up the trembling earth goddess?
You stay in the temple in Kuḍandai on the bank of the Kaviri
where the river spreads into many channels.
Get up, come and speak to us.
We praise you, O Kesava.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the mighty god who took the form of a lion
and split open the chest of the angry Hiraṇyan
with strong round arms, stay in Kurungudi
where Valai fish leap and make large palm fruits
fall into a pond, frightening a cow bathing there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the god of gods,
remove the bad karma
of those who do yoga and approach you.
In Paḍaham, filled with beautiful palaces and hills,
you are in a seated form and in Tiruvuraham, you stand,
but why are you lying down in Thiruvehka?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O father, you are stand in Thiruvuraham,
in Paḍaham you are seated and you recline in Thiruvehka.
When you took those forms, I was not born,
and since I was born I have not forgotten any of your forms
because you really stand, sit and rest in my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ancient god who stands in the Venkaṭam hills,
stays in heaven in the sky
and rests on the wide ocean with rolling waves snake bed Adishesha.
He, Madhavan, standing, sitting and resting in my heart, is a wonder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone knows that we will die
either today or shortly hereafter.
No one lives forever in this world.
You see this, O low people,
but you do not want to worship the feet
of the god who measured the world.
Don’t you want to go to heaven and be with the gods?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you worship the lotus feet of the divine lord
and listen to his praise,
you will go through the world of the sun,
reach moksha and find undiminished love and joy.
The virtuous god whose feet are as beautiful as lotuses
will listen to your prayers
and remove your bad karma and sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they leave this world,
those base people involved in worldly pleasures like wealth
will not achieve moksha.
There is no way for them to go to heaven.
If you want to survive,
you must praise the good god Thirumāl
adorned with fresh thulasi garlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you see some gods, they have terrible forms
and their praise is not sweet to the ears.
Even if you praise them they do not have the power
to give the boons you ask for.
O ignorant ones!
You live thinking they are your refuge.
If you want to survive,
there is only one refuge for you, our Thirumāl.
If you wish to release yourself from births,
worship our ancient Thirumāl..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gods in the sky,
carrying clubs, tridents, spears, drums, sticks and swords,
ran everywhere and hid
when Bānasuran came to fight with them.
On that day our Thirumāl fought with him
and cut off his thousand arms,
and took away all the troubles of the gods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Kaṇṇan took Usha,
and her father Bānasuran, knowing what had happened,
came to fight with him,
Kaṇṇan cut off his thousand arms
and Shiva, Agni and the other gods
who had come to help Bānasuran retreated.
Then, the Māyan forgave the Asuran and gave him moksha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goddess Lakshmi stays on a lotus,
the earth goddess stays with Thirumāl,
while Nānmuhan, the god’s son, sits on the lotus on his navel.
The sastras say that Shiva who shares his body with his wife
became his vehicle.
That is the truth and no one can deny it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He shot his arrows
and made holes in the seven mara trees.
As Rāma, he shot his arrows at Vali&rsquo;s chest and killed him.
Even the rulers of the sky
will not receive the endless joy of moksha
unless our god has given them his grace to receive it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you really know that your refuge is the feet of him
who took the form of Vāmanan and worship him,
you will have wealth and wonderful wisdom.
If you praise Thirumāl
who rests on the ocean with its clear rolling waves,
you will not have the results of your bad karma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only those who do good tapas thinking only of the lord
and who think constantly of the nature of Thirumāl
will go to heaven and stay with the other gods forever.
Except for those devotees no one can see the lovely-eyed Thirumāl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only if people control the feelings that arise from their senses
and light up their wisdom by following the good path
and melt in their bones and hearts for him
and love him who carries a discus can they see him. CHECK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ancient lord is eight and eight and eight,
he is seven and seven and seven,
and he is eight and three and one.
Devotees worshiping with the eight letter mantra,
“Om namo Nārāyaṇāya,” will go to heaven and rule there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people love him tirelessly
and think of him always in their minds,
reciting the eight-letter mantra with love
and worshiping the beautiful ankleted feet
of the god who rests on the snake bed on the ocean,
they will go to heaven and rule there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is the ten directions,
the soul of the ten guardians of the directions,
the nine notes of music, the nine rasas of dance
and he, the ancient and the most powerful one,
came to this world in ten avatharams.
Only if devotees worship him with devotion
will they reach moksha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Asuran Thenugam approached the lord without love
pretending to be his friend, he cut off his arms
but then he gave him moksa.
No one can reach moksha except the devotees
who worship the ankleted feet of the lord with love..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord stays in the Thiruvenkatam hills
who churned the milky ocean
and rests on the ocean forever.
He gave his grace to Vāli after killing him,
and destroyed the seven trees with one arrow
If you worship the feet of Thirumāl you will be saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who rest on the snake bed on the ocean,
the highest of the high,
are the incomparable one whom no one can know.
If devotees have destroyed their desires
and released themselves from attachment to the world,
they will receive happiness here, there and everywhere in all ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O you who wear cool thulasi garlands that drip pollen,
if someone controls his mind and worships you
with the eight letter mantra, “Om Namo Narayanaya,”
the joy he receives is higher than the joy of attaining moksha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does he who carries the discus
want me to be born again?
Does he know the day he made me love his ankleted feet?
I am ignorant, incapable of doing anything,
and do not know how to love him.
O dear lord, what did you find in me
to make me your devotee?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O lord resting on the snake bed,
I know your magic.
You know how to make my mind
that is interested in other worldly things
leave them and be devoted to your lotus feet.
You are truly clever.
If you make me fascinated with you,
what kind of fascination is that?
O Māyan, give me your grace
so I am not involved in worldly things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dance, dance with your feet.
You danced on the heads of the snake Kālingan
stirring the water in the pond,
O you who carry a conch in your hand.
I worship your beautiful feet every day
and think of you always.
Why have you not granted me moksha yet, O Kaṇṇa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the Vedas.
Shiva with an eye in his forehead,
the wise Nānmuhan staying on the lotus
and all other gods together worship your feet with love.
I will not speak of any other love
except the love that I have for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My generous lord churned the milky ocean,
using the mountain for a churning stick,
a turtle to support the mountain
and the white-fanged snake Vasuki for the rope.
He took the nectar that came from the ocean,
gave it to the gods in the sky,
and took away their troubles.
I will not worship any one except him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You became the charioteer for Arjuna,
destroyed the Kauravas
and gave the land to the five Pandavas,
sending their enemies to the sky
and saving the earth from evil ones.
O victorious one, I will not worship any other except you. .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was not born in one of the four varnas.
I have not learned any of the good arts
and do not recite the Vedas with my tongue.
I have not conquered the joy given by the senses.
O pure one, I have no good knowledge
and I have no refuge except your shining feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the sake of Sita with sharp sword-like eyes
and soft words like music
you burned countless Raksasas in Lanka.
I have no eyes except yours that make me see
and no relatives to be with except you.
You have endless magic.
How can I ever take you from my heart?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O cowherd who destroyed the seven bulls
and embraced the arms of Nappinnai and married her
with spear-like eyes that attracted all,
you created the oceans, you churned the milky ocean
and you rest on it. I come to you as my refuge.
Give me refuge, tell me, “Don’t be afraid!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the god of Srirangam,
adorned with a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,
give your grace to those who love and worship your feet.
You, as sweet as a bundle of sugarcane,
are Kaṇṇan resting on the ocean.
As Rāma, you shot powerful arrows with your bow
and destroyed the iron forts of Lanka.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You who are the life in our bodies,
our sleep and feelings,
the five things given by the cow,
the purity in all,
the sky and the earth,
the rich ocean and the things in it.
There is nothing without you.
You are our god and you are Rāma.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have destroyed the desires that come from the evil senses
cut off all the relations I had with others,
and I have come to you to serve you.
Even if you want me to have desires
and enjoy the pleasures of the five senses,
my only desire is to be with you.
I have no eyes except you,
O my king who rest on the ocean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do endless magic.
Even if all the true seven worlds were to praise you
for all the seven yugas, it would not be enough,
O god worthy of limitless praise.
O Pundariga! Please give me a boon
so I may escape from all my endless births
and come to your ankleted feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In your beautiful hands you carry
a discus, conch, club, bow and sword.
O lord with Lakshmi seated on a red lotus on your chest,
give me your grace so I will be saved
from the births that give sickness and sorrow.
Show me a way to come to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have left all the evil acts that I was committing
and now I have no cunning or fault,
none of the desires that the five senses bring.
I am like a dog and my only desire is to be with you.
O Māyan, give me the boon
of not being born and dying anymore and I will not forget you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the beloved of Nappinnai,
have the color of the kāyām flower.
My soul is tied to you.
I hear that the messengers of Yama
encourage people to be involved in cruel sins,
but I have locked you up in my heart with Nappinnai
and you save me from committing those sins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are Māyan whom no one can reach easily.
You save people even if they are evil, forgetting all good deeds,
thinking themselves wise and not understanding
that births cause them suffering in this world,
Give me your grace and make me your devotee
so I may worship your feet through devotion for you always.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to ask you one thing,
O you who have the color of the ocean.
If I worship you and always want to think of you in my mind,
won’t you also consider giving me your grace
so I may keep your lotus feet in my heart forever?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Māyan resting on the ocean with seething water,
my love for you is limitless
and I worship your shining lotus feet in my heart
so that they will take away all my troubles.
You, the victorious divine hero, took the form of a boar
and carried Govardhana mountain
to save the cows by sheltering them from the storm.
O lord, tell me how I can not be born and suffer in this world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O dark-colored god with the beautiful Lakshmi on your chest,
You, are faultless, the god of gods
and the god of justice proclaimed by the Vedas.
Give me your grace
so I may recite your names without ever ceasing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Māyan with many weapons in your strong arms,
who cut off the heads of the Asuras Vakkaran, Karan and Muran
when they came in anger to fight you,
give me your grace so I may always worship your feet
adorned with golden anklets
whether I am resting, standing or walking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You swallowed the earth,
and you begged for land and took it from Mahābali,
measuring it till there was no place you had not taken.
O lord with lotus eyes who embrace the woman
whose sweet words surpass music,
there is no other color like your color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O god carrying a conch, club, bow and a sword,
your discus cut off the head of Yama
when he came angrily to fight with you
and you carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows
when the storm came to destroy the cowherd village.
My heart loves nothing except your fame
that is spread everywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You destroyed the angry king of Kasi,
Vakkaran, Pavuṇḍran, the furious Maliman,
Sumali, Kesi and Thenugan.
I will not give my love and affection to anyone,
only to your anklet-adorned feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if I received faultless boons
and could go to the world of Nanmuhan
filled with abundant and indestructible wealth
or the world of Shiva
who has the power of destroying the world
or the world of thousand-eyed Indra,
even if I could have all the pleasures of moksha,
I would not accept or think of anything
except to be with you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You became a dwarf
even though no one made you small,
and, without anyone making you bigger,
you became tall even though no one made you tall
and touched the sky.
All the sages recite the Vedas,
praise you and say that you are the god of gods
and you destroy the evil of the proud,
and I join them in your praise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, Māyan, the pure one
wearing a cool thulasi garland that swarms with bees,
I, a dog, bow to you and worship you.
who are colored like the ocean and rest on the water of the sea.
You enter the thoughts of your devotees.
Forgive all my faults and give me your grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are the lord of the world.
Sages say that even they who slander you like Sisupalan
or fight with you like Ravaṇa in Lanka
have reached your world and joined with you by your grace O Māyan.
Take the mistakes that I, as low as a dog,
do as good deeds and forgive me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my heart, time will pass,
we will all get sick and grow old
and the time of our death will come near.
Bow to the divine feet of the god and worship him.
You should know that being a devotee of the god
is the only good thing. Only the feet of Thirumāl
can give you the joy of never being born again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Nanmuhan cursed dark-necked Shiva
in whose matted hair the Ganges flows
and Nanmuhan’s skull was stuck to Shiva’s palm,
our god whose chest is adorned with a fragrant garland
gave his blood and made Nanmuhan’s skull fall away.
O heart, think of the god’s thulasi garland and worship him
so that you will reach his Vaikuṇṭam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, if you want to remove the eight bad thoughts
and live without fault and reach moksha and rule the world,
you must think and worship the feet of the god, our father,
who is wisdom, the sun, and the world,
who took the form of a single-tusked boar and split open the earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our ruler and our mother, he destroys all our births,
makes us his devotees and gives us his grace.
O poor heart! He is Mukundan, the ancient one.
If we worship him he will enter us, stay with us
and remove our ocean of sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rāma the heroic one, went to Lanka,
fought with Ravana whose sword was mighty,
burned it, killed Ravaṇa and conquered Lanka.
My god does not think that I am like his enemies.
Yama will not think of the sins
I have done and afflict me
because I am a devotee of the god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He will take you to heaven
removing your fears, sickness, old age
and all your births.
Achudan, Anandan, the lord who fulfills his promises,
and has no beginning or end
rests on the snake bed
and is praised by the Vedas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O lord, beloved of Lakshmi,
I worshipped you with my words and in my deeds
and loved you unceasingly,
night and day, morning and evening.
My heart worshiped your lotus feet
and now it stays with you and will never come back to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Māyan with the color of a kāyām flower,
god of Srirangam surrounded by the Ponni river, hear me.
My heart has given up my bad karma
and worships your shining flower feet
remaining with them without ever growing tired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, colored like a cloud, the everlasting shining light,
took away all my future births and saved me today.
You came to me, entered my heart and bewitched me
and now my soul has been released from all pain
and has attained moksha, the house of joy.</p>
