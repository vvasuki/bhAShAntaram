<li>
<p>My love for him is a lamp,
the oil in the lamp is my desire to worship him,
and the wick is my sweet mind that melts for him.
I light the shining lamp with my wisdom.
I composed this Thiruvandāthi for Naraṇan
in divine Tamil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you stay in a good place
and recite the names of Nāraṇan,
understanding him well with your wisdom,
the nature of the king of the gods is to give you
the privilege of being a god among the gods in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If devotees worship sprinkling fragrant flowers
on the feet of the god resting on the milky ocean,
they will enter the shining world of the ancient god of the gods
where only the gods in the sky can enter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I string garlands with jewels, pearls,
diamonds and fresh flowers,
carry matchless beautiful lotuses, and worship the feet
of him on whose chest Lakshmi seated on a lotus
on the right side of his body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You asked for three feet of land as a boon
from Mahābali at his sacrifice
and measured the world and the sky with your two feet.
O Neḍumal, you are colored like the ocean rolling with waves!
Who is able to know the power of your feet and speak of it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If good-hearted devotees control their five senses,
do much tapas with love, sprinkle fresh flowers
and worship him reciting his names
they will see the ankleted feet of the ocean-colored god.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he raised his ankleted feet
and fought with his enemies Namusi and others
with his heroic discus,
he scared them and made their minds burn.
O heart, worship happily his divine golden lotus feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Putana took you in her lap
and gave milk from her beautiful breast saying, “Drink happily,”
you pretended to drink her milk and killed her.
Even though she came as a mother and gave milk to you,
you killed her because she had come to kill you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yashoda was not worried about giving you milk
from her breasts with love
even though she saw how you killed
Putana when she came and fed you milk.
Is even this ocean-encircled earth that you measured
equal to the love of that cowherd mother?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O lord, I think always of you
who kicked and killed Sakaṭasuran
when he came as a large cart
and protected the world.
You asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
and took over the whole earth and saved its people.
I worship you with my tongue,
sprinkling flowers on your feet.
The results of my karma are gone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people worship the feet of other gods
and enjoy life only for a short time,
but they do not worship you to attain eternal moksha.
O Neḍumal with the color of the ocean rolling with waves,
who can describe the might of your feet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of his devotes worship him will reach
the feet of him resting on the snake bed.
He treats everyone equally.
Even the bright sun that goes around the world,
Nānmuhan on a lotus
and Shiva with a forehead eye
worship the lord every day without ceasing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the large elephant Gajendra
went to the pond to pick up a beautiful lotus flower to worship him
he was caught by a crocodile,
and the lord came and saved him, killing the crocodile.
Wasn’t Gajendra saved and so he could reach the world of Indra,
because he worshipped the feet of the lord with a discus?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O ignorant ones, do not praise the people
of the world who perform many evil deeds
increasing their karma.
Recite the names of the lord who grew to the sky
and whose hands were extended in all the eight directions.
Wander as sages and go to all the temples
where he stays, worship him and become faultless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are these the things the lord enjoys—
driving the chariot in the terrible battle for Arjuna,
-chasing Marisan to catch him when he came as a golden deer,
losing Sita when she was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa
and resting on the beautiful snake bed Adisesha on the ocean?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he enters someone’s heart
and a devotee locks him in it,
the lord may not know that he is imprisoned in the devotee’s heart.
If someone does not dig out a pond on a mound in a forest
and save the rain water, there will be no water to flow and nourish the fields.
Lock him in your heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indra, the king of the gods, and Nānmuhan on a lotus
worshiped him and asked him to help them when they were in trouble.
Like them, Shiva with thick matted hair adorned with the crescent moon
went to Thirumāl, asked for his aid and received his grace
when the skull of Nānmuhan was stuck to his hand.
Who but our lord could have helped them all?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirumāl took the form of a dwarf
went to Mahābali’s sacrifice, grew tall
and measured the earth and the sky,
he took the form of a man-lion
split open the chest of Hiraṇyan with his claws,
and he swallowed all the seven worlds in the eon.
Did Thirumāl with beautiful eyes do these things to save the world?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Sakaṭasuran came as a cart, you kicked it and killed him,
but that is not all you did.
You also threw the calf on the vilam tree and killed the two Asurans.
The world may blame you for breaking a cart or throwing a small calf,
but you only did these things to protect the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your devotees do not sin or do bad deeds,
and only praise you
because they recite your name Narayaṇā without mistake
and understand your power, worshiping only you,
they will live happily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our lord, the beloved of Lakshmi, abides in the hearts of those devotees
who always think of him and worship him.
They have the good fortune of bowing to the feet of the lord
who took the form of a dwarf
and they will never go to cruel hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn’t the dark Gajendra, the large elephant with white tusks,
worship him with beautiful flowers and get what he wanted?
If someone wants to achieve something,
it will be easy for him if he truly tries like Gajendra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who threw the calf onto the vilam tree
and killed the two Asurans,
went to Mahābali&rsquo;s sacrifice in the form of a dwarf,
grew tall and measured the world and the sky with his two feet.
If devotees worship him and live following good paths,
he will give them a good life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O good heart, he is happiness and sorrow in life.
He is the five senses and he is the wind, fire, water, sky,
the dark mountains, the ocean with waves and burning fire.
He is everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, famed since ancient times, the creator of the Vedas,
praised by the gods in the sky,
went to Lanka angrily, fought with the Raksasas
and killed their king Rāvaṇa.
He has come to stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where bamboo plants grow on the cool slopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He rests on Adishesa on the ocean,
and in the Venkaṭam hills where his devotees
who have controlled their five senses,
their feelings and their minds come and worship him.
He gave the hills to the gods
so that they can come, live there and worship him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mind searches for Thirumāl CHECK
the god of Thiruvenkaṭam hills,
like a vine climbing on the wall
that grows towards the sky
looking for a stick to support it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ocean-colored lord
stays in Thiruvenkaṭam and in Thiruvarangam,
a place that is hard to conceive.
He split the mouth of Kesi when he came as a horse
and he is praised by all as the god of the gods, abiding in the hearts of all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You shot your arrows and destroyed southern Lanka.
You killed Putana when she came as a mother
to give you milk from her breasts.
Yet even though your mother Yashoda saw all these heroic deeds
she was not afraid to give you her milk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People say, “O ocean-colored Thirumāl!
You measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice,
became a boar and split open the earth
to bring the earth goddess up from the underworld,
churned the wide milky ocean, took nectar and gave it to the gods,
and made a bridge on the ocean
and went to Lanka to fight the Raksasas.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the devotees go every day in the morning taking fresh flowers
and worship the feet of the beautiful lord
who took the form of a beautiful boar
to bring back the earth goddess from the underworld,
they will see the lord’s shining form and be happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Thirumāl, my heart is happy
seeing you and worshiping your feet.
I am happy to sing and dance,
and your conch and fiery discus are happy seeing me
when I worship you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I bow to the feet of the lord
adorned with many thulasi garlands,
my heart feels happy.
I praise the heroic one with my tongue
the god of the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where bamboo grows on the slopes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a dwarf you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
and when he gave it, you measured the world and the sky with your feet.
I worshiped you lovingly with fragrant smoke and fresh flowers
and became your slave. This is my good fortune.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People say passion is sweet but water is sweeter.
O father, if people do not want passion or water
and only listen to your heroism
that will be the water that protects them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mean people can achieve fame only by doing mean deeds.
They know nothing.
O my heart, worship our Māyan
who swallowed the earth and spat it out
and be calm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You created the four-headed god,
the creator of the Vedas
who stays on a beautiful lotus on your navel.
If we do not praise your divine feet and bow to you
we will have only trouble in all our births.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not think you have much wealth
and depend on it to make your life without trouble.
You should think Mādhavan is yours and keep him in your heart.
Reciting his names with your tongue is just like reciting the Vedas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O ignorant people,
know how to praise the names of the good lord.
That is what the Vedas say.
If you follow what you have learned from the sastras that is good.
If you cannot do that,
just say the names of Mādhavan—
that is really the meaning of the Vedas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before Yama comes and throws his rope and catches you,
think of the names of the lord.
You know that real happiness is to worship the feet of the lord
with Lakshmi on his chest.
There is no other thing could bring you happiness
except to know the lord and worship his feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one can enter the world of the gods just by wealth.
The only way to attain moksha is by his grace.
O heart, don&rsquo;t forget his sapphire-colored feet
that give moksha to divine sages.
Always meditate on his names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think of Thirumāl always.
If devotees worship and meditate on the wide arms of the lord,
they will not have any future births.
Just by worshiping him
the sages get all the happiness
that those receive who were born
to enjoy family life in this world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He shot his arrows and cut off
all the twenty arms, ten heads and two feet
of Rāvaṇa and killed him.
The only good use of my arms is to worship
the feet of the devotees who worship his feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For good devotees,
the names of beautiful-eyed Thirumāl are a true help.
I will not consider those who forget him as human beings.
Keep in your mind the name Mādhavan,
the god of dharma, and recite his names—
that is the only good thing that you should do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
worshiped by the gods in the sky
is himself the Vedas
whose meanings are endless.
If devotees worship his feet
they will have no pride whether they are rich or poor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The generous sapphire-colored lord
stays in Srirangam, Thirukkoṭṭiyur
and in his favorite place, Thiruvenkaṭam.
He is lord of beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
and Thiruneermalai flourishing with abundant water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Folding your hands with devotion in your heart,
worship him in the morning when you get up
and sprinkle flowers on the feet of him -
who took the form of a man-lion and fought with Hiraṇyan,
-measured the world at Mahābali’s sacrifice,
-swallowed the world and spat it out
and split open the earth to bring the earth goddess from the underworld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Thirumāl, you taught the sages all the four Vedas
and the sastras that teach morals.
Embracing Lakshmi on a lotus on your chest,
you stay happily on the beautiful Thirumālirunjolai
surrounded with beautiful large groves on its slopes
where bamboos grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my heart! Praise him and call to him without fear, saying ,
“You drank the poisonous milk from the breasts of Putana
as the seven mountains, seven worlds and the seven sounding oceans
were all shaken.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will call Thirumāl with his faultless names saying,
“You are the cowherd adorned with precious ornaments,
the Yādavan, the Māyavan, loved by all.”
In front of everyone I am calling Mādhavan with love
in the same way all the cowherds call him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart,
Think of the feet of the lord who has the sapphire color of the ocean
and recite his wonderful names.
Worship the feet of him who churned the milky ocean
and gave nectar to the gods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dark-colored one
with Lakshmi on a beautiful lotus on his chest
is the lord of dharma.
He sent the evil king Rāvaṇa
who fought valiantly with his sword
to the world of Indra, the king of the gods in the sky.
Who knows how he gives his grace?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would go and worship the lord in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where the blooming creepers think
that the thick hair of women
falling low on their backs
are small hills and cling on to it to grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O lord, you wish to stay
in the Venkaṭam and Thirumālirunjolai hills
surrounded with thick groves.
Like those hills, I make my heart your temple,
worship you and say,
&ldquo;Do not leave my heart, for it is your young temple
and it is like the milky ocean for you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are wise and carry a heroic discus.
In all my seven births I have never forgotten you—
and I have been mindful of you.
Give me your grace so I may plunge into the ocean of joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one gazes at the grass growing on the shore of the ocean
and tells it to be shy, will it become shy?
(Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, shows her golden body
before our Thirumāl shows his dark body to us.)
OR Lakshmi shows the dark body of Thirumāl to us
before Thirumāl shows his body to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Praise him with your tongue
who embraces Lakshmi on his chest
and gives his grace to all.
Have you heard? Devotees from all the directions
praise the name of our lord and worship his feet,
because it is our right to praise him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of my good karma,
Saraswathi stays in my good heart
and has taught me what to do.
She gives her grace and tells me,
“Just as margosa, even though it is bitter, gives good health,
the golden discus which the lord carries to fight his enemies
is only to only protect the world and the gods.
Praise his golden discus!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worship his devotees with my good heart
and no longer do wrong.
My evil thoughts have gone away
and I think only of his beautiful lotus feet,
meditate on him and worship him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not have only one form.
A shining form is yours,
and the vast world says you have two forms.
See, if devotees know your ancient form
they will rule the world with justice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People say that as a thief
you took the form of a bachelor dwarf,
went to king Mahābali and asked for three feet of land.
You measured the world with one of your feet
and raised the other foot and touched the sky,
as your arms extended to all directions.
How fortunate they are who described you like this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not have the fortune of worshiping you,
and I did not receive your grace because I was not wise.
I only praised and worshiped you saying things which are not true.
O, bull of the cowherds! You broke the horns of the seven bulls
and conquered them to marry Nappinnai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were to describe how our father
conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai
and how he poured his blood into Nānmuhan’s skull
that was stuck to Shiva’s hands and made it fall,
they would be long stories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Kaṇṇa, all the stories that anyone tells,
no matter what they are about,
are only about you and nothing else.
My heart wants to praise you.
You are the stories and the divine words in them.
Give me your grace so I may understand your stories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worship your divine body,
I bow to your beautiful lotus feet with love
and I worship you folding my hands.
I searched for you, my refuge,
and know that the best life for me
is to praise and live where you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See, O good heart,
this birth is what has happened to us.
If we praise the names of Nārāyaṇan
resting on the ocean on a snake bed,
that will be the way to avoid going to hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw his divine body in a dream,
his hands and the fiery discus that he carries
and found that he is the strength
that will remove the results
of my good and bad karma
and the troubles of my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, the king broke the tusks of the elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam,
used big Mandara mountain as a churning stick
and the enormous snake Vasuki as a rope, churned the milky ocean,
and gave the nectar to the gods,
cheating the strong Asurans with sharp teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even the kings of famous countries
who ride horses have been devotees
of the lord for their seven births.
on whose navel Nānmuhan abides on a lotus,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The places of our heroic lord,
skilled in shooting arrows and conquering his enemies,
are the hearts of his devotees,
divine Srirangam, the cool milky ocean,
Thirukkaḍalmallai praised by devotees,
Thirukkovalur and Thirukkuḍandai surrounded with walls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the lord who rests on the poisonous snake Adishesa
raised his flower-like feet, grew to the sky and measured the world,
the conch in his left hand sounded loud and his shining discus
that conquers his enemies shot out fire in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The monkeys in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
enter the ponds where flowers bloom, bathe,
take flowers place them on his feet and worship him.
O heart, come, let us go there, recite his divine names,
place the flowers on his feet and worship him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the elephant Gajendra
with tusks like crescent moons and angry eyes
was caught by a crocodile,
our lord went to the pond, killed the crocodile and saved him.
I have decided to become his slave,
praising his thousand names
and placing fresh flowers on his feet every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have received the fruit of all the tapas of seven births,
for I have composed a wonderful garland of Tamil pāsurams
and placed it at his feet.
I am fortunate to have written them in fine Tamil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord colored like a cloud
stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where a male elephant dripping with ichor
plucks bamboo sticks, soaks them in honey
and gives them to his mate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is good for us to take the sandal paste from the hills,
precious ornaments, silk clothes,
and fragrant white jasmine flowers
and offer them at the feet of the wise ancient lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O good heart, if we worship the faultless lord
offering beautiful lotus flowers at his beautiful feet
and reciting his thousand names and praising him,
that is the only tapas we need to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he grew, measuring the world and the sky,
Nānmuhan was the only one who had the fortune
of washing his golden feet with the water of the Ganges
and embracing and praising him with all his divine names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Rama’s mother Kosalai asked him
not to go to the forest he did not listen to her,
and when his wife Sita, soft as a flower,
told him not to go, he did not listen to her either.
Wanting only to obey his father’s order, he went to the forest.
The strength he showed then was equal to when he measured the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have become his slave, love him
and think only of his divine lotus feet
lovely as lotuses dripping with honey.
The joy of worshiping his feet is sweeter
than the joy of seeing his form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw Nārayaṇan in the day and in my dreams at night,
and again I saw him truly.
I worship the beautiful shining feet of the lord
who carries a discus smeared with flesh
and his bright form in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lakshmi with lovely long sword-like eyes
sees his divine form all the time as she stays on his chest.
Why does the earth goddess feel jealous of her?
The beauty of his form will never be reduced
no matter who sees him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With my poor words I worship Thirumāl
whom the Vedas praise with their divine words
thinking that Māyan might somehow accept me
and give me a small bit of his grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord went as a man-lion and killed Hiraṇyan
who had the boon that no one could kill him
and afflicted the gods, not obeying anyone.
It is like drinking nectar in this beautiful world
to worship his feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worshiped him saying,
&ldquo;He is nectar. He is honey.
He carries a discus. He churned the milky ocean,
got the nectar and joyfully gave it to the gods.”
I praised and worshiped the lord with a garland
of words sweet as nectar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poets cannot see him,
they can only praise him with garlands of words.
Even sages doing true tapas cannot see the cloud-colored god.
What kind of tapas I could have done that I see him now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do I know only today the feet of the lord
who measured the world?
When I was in my mother’s womb itself I knew him
and worshiped him with folded hands.
I know the power of my father, the god of Thirukkoṭṭiyur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that the only way to reach our father,
the god of Thennarangam, is to leave family life
and think of him always.
If devotees follow the divine path,
they will not go to cruel hell
and the guarded door of the gods’ world will open for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you, who were angry with Kamsan, fought and killed him,
and fought with elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam and broke its tusks,
go to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf
and ask for three feet of land in ancient times just to take over the world?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Won’t I rule this world
and go to the world of the gods
and stay with them in the sky
if I go and worship lovely-eyed Neḍumāl of Thirumalai?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ocean-colored lord who saved the Vedas
received a boon from Mahābali
and measured the world and the sky with his two divine feet.
If you worship him, he will give his grace
and you will not have to worry about hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neḍumāl with a Garuḍa banner,
and is praised by the gods in the sky
killed Kamsan by kicking him with his feet.
If you worship him and praise his names
quickly you will find how to receive all that you wish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hell is cruel and if you collect bad karma
you will go to the most cruel of hells.
Before any such terrible thing happens to you,
worship without ceasing the lord with a conch in his hand
who split open the mouth of the Asuran when he came as a bird
and drank the milk of Putana and killed her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart bows to his feet
and worships the cloud-colored god of beautiful Thiruppāḍagam,
who split open the chest of his enemy Hiraṇyan
and swallowed all the seven worlds,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my heart, all the world praises
the sapphire-colored lord of Thiruvathiyur
who split open the chest of the Asuran Hiraṇyan,
swallowed all the earth at the end of the eon
and spat it out again to save it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The highest lord of Athiyur who rides on an eagle
and rests on the ocean on Adishesa with diamonds on his head,
is the god of the three sacrifices and the Vedas.
He is the lord of Shiva who drank poison
that came from the milky ocean
and he is also our dear lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, lovely-eyed Neḍumal, king of the gods in the sky,
abide, embracing Lakshmi on your chest,
in the temple of Kuḍamukku
resting on the ocean on thousand-mouthed Adishesa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who was born on the earth,
raised in a cowherd village as Nandan’s son,
grazed the cows, danced on a pot
and swallowed all the earth
stays in my heart</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2280 . Thirumāl with beautiful eyes went as a dwarf
to Mahābali’s sacrifice and measured the earth and the sky
with his two feet, making Mahābali his slave
as the gods in the sky sprinkled flowers on his divine feet
ornamented with sounding anklets and asked him for his grace.</p>
<ol start="2281">
<li>O Thirumāl, Neḍumāl, Kaṇṇan,
adorned with a wonderful thulasi garland
and lord of the gods in the sky,
who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans,
my love for you has no limit.</li>
</ol>
