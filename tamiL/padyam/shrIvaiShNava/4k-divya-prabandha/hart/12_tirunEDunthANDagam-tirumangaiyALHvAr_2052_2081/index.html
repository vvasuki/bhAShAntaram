<h2 id="praising-god">Praising god</h2>
<ol start="2052">
<li>
<p>Shining like lightning, he is the four Vedas,
the light of a lamp, the rising crescent moon,
the past and the future.
Without sickness, old age, birth or death,
he is gold and diamond
and shines as the five elements–earth, water, fire, wind and sky.
He, my father, enters me with his true form
and I keep his divine shoot-like feet on my head.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is fire, water, wind, sky and earth,
all religions and all the three gods,.
Shiva is colored red like fire, Nānmuhan is colored like gold
and Thirumāl is colored like the ocean—
our lord shines with all their three forms together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neḍumal with his divine body who is far away
shone with the white color of a conch in the Treta yuga.
When he took the nectar from the milky ocean,
our divine Thirumāl had a dark blue color.
We cannot say that he has only one form,
we can only praise him saying
that he has different forms in each eon.
Who has seen the dark beautiful-eyed god?
Who can describe him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our lord who is more ancient than Indra and Nānmuhan.
is the five elements–the large earth, wind, fire water and sky,
the beautiful sound of Tamil,
the words of the northern language,
the four directions, the sun and moon.
Even the gods in the sky do not know him and his divine nature.
He is the secret of the mantras of the Vedas
that the Vediyars recite in the evening.
O ignorant heart, do not forget those mantras.
If you recite them always and live, you will be saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he came as a dwarf to king Mahābali’s sacrifice,
he measured the earth and the ocean with one foot
and he raised his other foot to the wide sky
spreading over all the eight directions
and crossed the cool moon, the sun and the stars
and went still above,
going beyond all the thoughts in the Asuran Mahābali’s mind.
I worship the flower-like divine feet of my father
that measured the whole earth and the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He, the god of the gods, is generous
and he gives to his devotees
as much as they want with his ample hands.
He rides on the beautiful-winged Garuḍa,
conquers the Asuras, not giving them his grace.
O heart, let us go and praise his feet in beautiful Thirukkovalur
where the Peṇṇai river flows flourishing
through many lands filling ponds with its water
and bringing with its waves
tall bamboo plants that throw out pearls
and leaving gold on its banks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He came as Parasurāman, fought with kings
whose arms are wide and strong as mountains,
conquered them and ruled the world,
and he conquered Murugan
who threw his spear at the ocean to fight with Asurans.
He stays in Thirukkovalur
where famous king Malaiyarasan worshiped him,
surrounded by fragrant groves
and filled with long streets and lotus ponds,
guarded by the lovely chaste goddess of the Vindya mountains.
O heart, come, let us go and worship him there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are in the hearts of your devotees
and in Thiruneeragam, on the top of Thiruneermalai,
Nilāthingalthuṇḍam in Thiruppadi,
Thiruvuragam in flourishing Kachi,
and Thiruvekka surrounded with flourishing water.
The whole world worships you, the god of Thirukkāragam.
O thief, you stay in the sky and in Thirupperur
where on the southern bank of the Kāviri
beautiful flowers bloom in the groves.
You, the highest one, stay in my heart and you will not leave me.
I worship only your divine feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You stay in Thirumallai on the ocean
where ships bring precious diamonds
and in Kachi surrounded with forts and in Thirupperur.
As part of your body, you have Shiva,
adorned with a beautiful kondrai garland dripping with honey
who shares his body with Shakthi, the daughter of the king of the Himalayas.
You, the highest in the world, beautiful as coral,
rest on Adisesha on the milky ocean
and stay on the peak of the Himalayas, the snow mountains.
I, a poor man, wander everywhere looking for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You, the famous one, guarded the seven worlds
and I am your poor devotee.
What can I do except prattle on, saying,
“What are you? Who are you?”
You are the god of the southern, northern, eastern and western lands
praised by the whole world,
the first among the gods, a bright light worshiped by all.
You are the past and the future.
You, the origin of all, stay in Thirumuzhikkaḍalmallai.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A worrying mother!</p>
<ol start="2062">
<li>
<p>Her mother says,
“My daughter wears silk garments.
She feels tired and sad
and doesn’t want to play with her doll.
Her eyes are filled with tears and she can’t sleep.
She doesn’t want to sit on my lap at all.
She asks, ‘Where is my lord’s Srirangam?’
I asked the fortune teller about her
‘O fortune teller,
my daughter whose fragrant hair swarms with bees
that have drunk honey from flowers is as soft as a doe.
Who makes her worry like this? Tell me the truth.’
She said, ‘It is the ocean-colored god.’
He is our protector
and if he has done this who can save us?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter’s heart melts with love for him
and her eyes are filled with tears.
She stands searching until she is tired.
She sighs and doesn’t want to eat or sleep.
She says, ‘O Nambi, who rest on the snake bed,
you are lord of Thiruvayalāli
surrounded with beautiful creepers blooming with flowers.
O friend! Shall we go there dance and sing
where the Garuḍa flag flies?
Can we go and play in the water in beautiful Srirangam?’
I gave birth to this girl but she doesn’t listen to me.
A pity! The world is blaming me for what she does.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter says,
‘You carried Govardhana mountain
and protected the cows and the cowherds from the storm
and you stay in Thiruvarangam in beautiful Kachi.
You, the king resting on Adisesha in Thiruvekka
broke the bow and married Sita and embraced her soft arms,
and you fought with the wrestlers and killed them.
You are young and strong and you killed the Asuran Kesi
when he came as a horse.’
She teaches her parrot to say his names,
shedding tears and they drip on her breasts
and she is tired.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter says,
‘He is a sprouting shoot with the dark color of a cloud
and he stays in Thirukkuṛunguḍi.
He is the first one, without any end,
who came as a dwarf, grew tall
and crossed over all the three worlds at Mahābali’s sacrifice.
Faultless, limitless nectar, he stays in Srirangam.
and in the minds of the Vediyars.
Like the brightness of a lamp and precious like an emerald,
he stays in Thiruthangā and Thiruvekkaa.’
When my daughter sings the praise of Thirumāl
her parrot listens and sings with her.
She is happy that she taught her beautiful parrot the praise of the lord
and she says ‘I taught you the praise of the lord and I am happy to hear that from you. ’ &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; She folds her hands and worships him.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter says,
‘He, mighty as an elephant,
stays in Kachi surrounded by strong stone walls.
He is a sweet fruit and he rests on Adisesha on the ocean.
Our father happily stays in beautiful Thiruvazhundur
surrounded with fields, ponds and blooming alli flowers.’
My innocent daughter carries a veena
that touches her breasts, smiles beautifully
and plucks it with her fingers, making them red
as she sings like a prattling parrot.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter says,
‘You, mighty as a bull, happily grazed the cows.
You are my sweet fruit and you stay in Thirukkaṇṇapuram
surrounded with fragrant groves.
You are the god of Thiruvenkaṭam in the north
and you danced happily in the mandram.
You stay in Thirunaṛaiyur surrounded with abundant groves.
O king, you conquered the Asurans and destroyed their tribes,
and you, with a dark color and thick curly hair, are my help.’
The tears she sheds fall on her breasts and she is tired.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter’s round soft breasts
have changed their color to gold and are pale.
Her fish eyes are filled with tears.
She melts when she hears the voice of the lovely red-legged dove
calling softly for its mate.
Praising Thiruthangaa, flourishing Thirukkuḍanthai
and Thirukkovalur where he stays, she sings and dances.
When I asked my daughter,
‘Dear girl, do you think what you’re doing is good for our family?’
she only praises Thirunaraiyur and sings.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter says,
‘Colored like a dark cloud,
he has hands and feet that are like beautiful lotuses.
He loves the beautiful earth goddess
and he is crazy about doll-like Lakshmi.’
What have I done?
My lovely innocent daughter doesn’t listen to me,
but asks me, ‘Where is Srirangam of my divine lord?
I will go to Thiruneermalai where the ocean-colored lord stays.’
Is this the way women talk who have lost their chastity?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My daughter’s breasts have not grown out yet.
Even though she knows that beautiful Lakshmi stays on his chest
she lost her chastity for him.
She sighs and says to her friend,
‘O friend, shall we go to Srirangam and play in the water?’
I gave birth to her but she doesn’t listen to me.
She just sings and praises the names
of the god of Thirupperur and Thirukkuḍandai
and goes to bathe in the ponds
where golden lotuses bloom.
There is no one precious like her for me.
Does your daughter, precious as gold,
do the same things as mine?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her mother says,
“He, the generous lord, burned the southern Lanka
and destroyed the wealth of the Rakshasa Rāvaṇa
who carried a shining sword and drove his chariot heroically.
He cut off the thousand arms of Vāṇāsuran,
and as a dwarf, he measured the world with one foot
and crossed the earth with the other.
He, ruler of the world, swallowed the earth, spat it out
and kept it again in his stomach and protects it.
My daughter praises his divine names always
and we can only say that she must have done marvellous tapas
to praise his names always on this earth.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>The daughter’s worry</p>
<ol start="2072">
<li>
<p>The daughter says to her friend ,
“O friend, the dark-colored lord with fragrant hair
hunts with a strong bow.
He wore shining emerald earrings swinging from both his ears.
He came together with Lakshmi and stood in front of me
and I was fascinated with his beautiful lotus hands,
mouth, eyes and feet.
O friend, I was afraid he might be divine.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter says,
“He came, sang the raga naivaḷam,
and looked at me, standing there as if he was shy.
As soon as I heard his song,
my mind and eyes went to the dear lord
and I bowed to his divine feet.
The bracelets on my hands and the mekalai on my waist
became loose and fell and I couldn’t see them.
I saw only his golden emerald earrings and his four arms.
I asked him, ‘How far is the temple of our dear lord?’
and he answered, ‘This indeed is the beautiful Thiruvāli, his temple.’”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter says,
“He gave me his love and made my heart suffer.
He made my golden color turn pale
and my shining bangles become loose.
He told me, ‘My place is Srirangam
where fish drink the sweet water
dripping from the young coconut trees’ and left.
I saw him adorned with fresh thulasi garland
that drips honey in my dream
and told him, ‘O lord, you ride on Garuḍa, don’t go away.
Whatever is happening, it seems that are quarreling.” X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her daughter says,
“What a pity!
The conch bangles on my hands have grown loose.
The ocean-colored lord
with a conch in one hand and in the other a discus
and who swallowed the whole world
came here, loved me, told me that he stays in Srirangam
and went, leaving me with the sorrow of love
and filling my eyes that are like fighting fish with tears.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her daughter says,
“The heroic lord who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeedam
with his mighty arms and shines like lightning
has a beautiful mouth and eyes
and wears a fresh fragrant thulasi garland and emerald earrings.
He took away my health, chastity, and thoughts,
making my bangles loose and I became his slave.
As he went through the fragrant cherundi grove
blooming with golden flowers,
he said his place is Srirangam surrounded with water and left.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her daughter says,
“O small bee with six legs and dots on your wings,
you and your mate stay happily on flowers and drink honey.
I bow to you. Go to the god of the gods
who loves the cows and grazes them
and stays in beautiful Thiruvazhundur.
Stay there and see him. Don’t be afraid.
Tell him , ‘I am a girl and love him.’
and see what he says.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter says,
“O beautiful red-legged crane,
if you go today to Thirukkaṇṇapuram
and tell my beloved lovely-eyed Thirumāl of my love,
nothing could make me more happy.
I will give you all this flourishing land
and fish from the ponds to eat.
You and your beloved mate can come here,
stay happily and enjoy your life.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter says,
“O friend, he who destroyed the forts of southern Lanka
and killed the Rakshasas,
measured the earth and the sky
and drove the chariot for Arjuna in the Bharatha war
is large as a mountain and strong as an elephant.
I will embrace him with my gold-ornamented breasts.
I won’t let him go. I will plunge into the love for him
thinking always of him,
melting with joy that fills my body.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter says,
“My lord, the beloved of Nappinnai the cowherd girl,
churned the milky ocean with waves,
shot his arrows and killed the king of the Rakshasas
whose strength never failed, conquering and destroying the Raksasas,
and carried Govardhana mountain in his arms, protecting the cows.
I am his slave and I worship Neḍumāl,
the tall god of cool Thirukuḍanthai and Thiruvinnagaram
surrounded by the ocean rolling with waves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the gods and the sages praised
and worshiped you saying,
“You are the god of the gods in the sky. Give us your grace,”
you, our father with the color of a dark cloud shining with lightning,
took the form of a swan, brought up the divine Vedas
from the bottom of the ocean and taught them to the sages.
Kaliyan, with a sharp spear, Yama for his enemies
and the chief of Thirumangai filled with palaces
studded with precious shining jewels,
composed a wonderful garland of ten Tamil pasurams.
If devotees learn and recite these pasurams
they will not have the results of their karma.</p>
