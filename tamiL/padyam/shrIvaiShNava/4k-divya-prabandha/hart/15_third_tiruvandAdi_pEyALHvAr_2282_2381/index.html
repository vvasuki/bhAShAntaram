<li>
<p>I saw today the divine form of the ocean-colored lord,
his golden body adorned with jewels
that shone with the color of the bright sun
and the golden discus in his hands that fights in war
and the sounding curving conch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today I saw his ankleted feet
and now I will not be born again for seven births.
O Thirumāl with a mountain-like golden chest ,
You are adorned with a cool thulasi garland,
and you embrace your beloved Lakshmi from the milky ocean.
I find you with love in my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ocean-colored lord stays in my mind
who, angry at his enemies on the battlefield,
fought with them and killed them.
His chest is adorned with thulasi garlands,
and he rests on a snake bed on the wide ocean and embraces Lakshmi.
He is the remedy that will save me from going to hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feet of the lovely-eyed lord
who swallowed all the seven worlds and spat them out,
measured the earth and the sky
and received a boon from Mahābali for three feet of land
are wealth, nectar and remedy for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feet of the lord with a discus
who measured the world are lotus-colored,
his body has the color of the ocean that surrounds the world
and the brightness of his crown is like the sun on its chariot.
All these things make him beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is lovely to see his ocean-colored body,
it is lovely to see him cross the world with his feet,
it is lovely to see Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus
and brought the Ganges to wash the feet of Thirumāl
after the lord took water in his hand
to get three feet of land from Mahābali
so that he could measure the earth and the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, come, let us worship the feet of the lord
who measured the world surrounded with dark ocean.
He rides on Garuḍa and flies around the groves.
He is hard for anyone to understand
and he is inapproachable for all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O good heart,
let us worship him folding our hands
and recite his many names,
praising him and saying, “ Nārāyaṇā!”
May our eyes see only Kaṇṇan,
adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
who swallowed all the worlds and spat them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His eyes and hands are like lovely lotuses
and he has beautiful lotus feet that measured the world.
The shining body of the lord has the color of a cloud,
the ocean and a precious sapphire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people praise the brightness, strength,
beauty, form, faultless family and all other things of the lord
with a beautiful white conch in his right hand
and if they recite his names, all goodness will come to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is in the four Vedas that are recited by all
and he has the color of a waterfall descending quickly
and filled with honey.
He carries a sounding conch in his hands
and rests on the snake bed Adisesha on the milky ocean.
He is the knowledge of the learned ones
of the ocean of sastras.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devotees who cultivate knowledge,
recite the Vedas well, control and close the door
to the feelings of five senses
and meditate on the beautiful ocean-colored lord
will see his nature every day in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In ancient times
when Thirumāl went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
took water in his hands and asked for three feet of land
and received it,
he grew tall and measured the world
and his crown split the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If devotees who have given up the desire to embrace women
learn the sastras and put their minds on the lord of Thiruvenkaṭam
praised by all the four Vedas
and worshiped in the sky by the gods
whose crowns touch the feet of the lord,
they will reach him easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our father, resting on the ocean rolling with waves
on Adisesha whose head bears jewels,
came and stays in my heart
and I became his slave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father shining like a beautiful lamp
of red corals and precious pearls
born in the ocean rolling with white waves
stays in Thiruvallikkeṇi
embracing vine-like Lakshmi’s chest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the days I have lived in the past,
and the days I live in the present and the future
are good days if I constantly praise the lovely-eyed Thirumāl.
May my mouth praise him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Neḍumāl,
you went to Mahābali’s sacrifice as a dwarf,
asked for three feet of land, received it,
and grew to the sky and measured the earth and the sky.
Give me your grace so that all of my fears will go away
and I will be a slave to your feet in all my seven births.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was born as a child and slept on the banyan leaf
at the end of the eon, and gave his grace
to his devotees who, without any faults in their minds,
sprinkled fresh flowers on his feet,
folded their hands, stood before him and worshiped him.
How could not give his grace to his devotees now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Thirumāl, you, the tall god with beautiful eyes,
swallowed all the worlds and spat them out in ancient times.
How could it have been difficult for you to measure
the earth and the sky with your two feet at Mahabali’s sacrifice?
O divine lord? Tell us all about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the Asuran Vakkaran came to fight with our lord,
who is adorned with a fragrant thulasi garland
and carries a shining discus in his right hand
and a conch in his left, he killed the Asuran.
He will present himself in whatever form
people wish to think he has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, the beautiful gods in the sky adorned with crowns
sprinkle fragrant flowers on his feet and worship him,
and you, O devotees, should worship the lord the same good way
following the sastras, and with your hearts melting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worship his feet ornamented with golden anklets,
my mind enthralled with the lord
adorned with a thulasi garland swarming with lovely-winged bees
that make buds bloom when they blow on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, worship every day the ankleted feet
of the lord with a beautiful shining discus in his hand.
He is the blowing wind, the wide earth,
the sky where clouds float, strong fire and the ocean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O, heart, there is nothing wrong if you worship the lord
who swallowed all the earth and kept it in his stomach,
ate butter that lovely-haired Yasodha churned and kept,
conquered the seven bulls for Nappinnai,
and is praised by all the gods in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord, adorned with a cool thulasi garland
and resting on beautiful-eyed Adisesha,
stays in my devoted heart
and in famous Kachi, Thiruvenkaṭam, Thiruvekkaa, and Thiruveḷukkaippāḍi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How could they have any troubles
if his devotees reach and worship the dark ocean-colored lord,
the origin of everything, who churned the milky ocean
and rests on the sea on Adisesha?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The highest lord, our father resting on the snake bed,
drank milk from the breasts of the devil Putana,
fought the Bharatha war to help the five Pandavas,
and was spanked with a churning stick
by the cowherdess Yasodha when he stole the butter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without being afraid the cowherdess Yasodha
took and embraced dark-colored Kaṇṇan
and fed him milk after he had drunk the milk of the devil Putana
as a beautiful baby prattling with his sweet coral mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirumāl adorned with a thulasi garland
and resting on Adisesha on the ocean
stays in Kudanthai surrounded by the sea,
in Thiruvenkaṭam, in my pure mind, in the divine sky, in Iṛaipāḍi
and in beautiful Pāḍaham where Vediyars recite the Vedas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who stays on the milky ocean
on the earless serpent Adisesha worshiped by all the four Vedas
and took the form of a man-lion and split open the chest of Hiraṇyan.
He shares his body with Shiva adorned with a snake in whose hair the Ganges flows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gopalan who broke the Kurundam trees and killed the Asurans
abides on Adisesha on the milky ocean, in Thiruvenkaṭam,
the cool sky, all the sastras, the mind of Lakshmi,
the hearts of the sages plunged in yoga
and in my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Thirumāl, it is true
that you swallowed all the seven worlds
at the end of the eon,
lay on a banyan leaf as a baby,
churned the milky ocean with Mandara mountain
and gave the nectar to all the gods in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, see!
The faultless lord who killed the Asuran Kamsan
stands in Thiruvezhukkai,
and recline- on Adisesha on the ocean.
Is he exhausted because he measured the world
at Mahābali’s sacrifice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My eyes say, “I want to see him, I want to see him!”
Folding our hands, we sing his praise
and worship the shining golden feet
of the god resting on the ocean
whose golden body is adorned with rich shining ornaments
and a thulasi garland swarming with bees that sing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dark ocean-colored Māyan
who measured the world and the sky
with his two feet and rests on the cool ocean
carries a fiery discus in one hand,
and a white conch in the other,
and a heroic club, a bow and a shining sword.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I became the slave of the lord colored like the rolling ocean
who is inside and outside of all,
with shining jewels
and coral-mouthed Lakshmi on his divine chest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though all forms in the world are his forms,
he can be compared only to himself.
Our lord, the Māyan whose form is tapas
is all the stars, burning fire, the eight directions, tall hills
and the shining sun and moon in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our lord is in the hearts of all
who is the earth, the eight directions,
the Vedas, the meaning of the Vedas,
the sky, and the god of the Thiruvekaṭam hills
where pure waterfalls descend with a lovely sound.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, the faultless lord,
the king who measured the world,
is in the hearts of all his devotees
and in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
with peaks that touch the sky
and waterfalls flowing with abundant water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the lord who carried Govardhana mountain
as an umbrella to protect the cows and the cowherds
measured the world,
his diamond-studded crown touched the sky,
his hands extended in all the eight directions,
his ankleted feet encircled all the thick groves of the earth
and his dress shone like lightning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sapphire-colored Kaṇnan who grazed the cows
and played the flute killed the Asuran when it came in the form of a horse.
When the lord was angry at Hiraṇyan, he took the form of a man-lion
and split open his chest with his sharp claws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who embraces the earth goddess on his chest
and fought with the angry elephant Kuvalayaabeeḍam
and broke its tusks
swallowed all worlds into his stomach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is the world, the eon, the ocean
the shining sun and moon and red fire.
O heart, worship the feet of the lord happily,
whose pure golden crown shines with bright rays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thiruvenkaṭam where a strong bull elephant
fights lovingly with his mate
and wanders angrily, spilling pearls from its white ivory tusks
is the hill of the lord
who swallowed all the earth in ancient times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the lord churned the milky ocean
using Mandara mountain as a churning stick
and the snake Vasuki as the rope,
pulling the rope with the gods on one side
and the Asurans on the other,
the water rose up and touched the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O lord with beautiful eyes,
when Mahābali promised to give you three feet of land
you took it and grew tall and measured the whole earth and the sky.
Adorned with a thulasi garland,
you split open the mouth of Kesa when he came as a horse.
You close the door of hell and save us so we do not enter it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn’t you make Mahābali pour water on your hands
and promise to give you three feet of land
when you went to him as a dwarf
and measured the world and the sky with your two feet?
Didn’t you graze the cows?
Didn’t you split open the mouth of the horse?
And didn’t you go between the marudu trees and fight with Devasuran?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With curved conch in your hands,
you fought with your enemy Hiraṇyan and killed him,
you asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
took over the earth and the sky,
and you fought with seven bulls
to marry Nappinnai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O Thirumāl, when the elephant Gajendra
was caught by a cruel crocodile in a spring filled with beautiful water,
you, the beautiful dark-colored Kaṇṇan
adorned with a shining jewel-studded crown and thulasi garlands,
killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He protected the cows and the cowherds
with Govardhana mountain when there was a big storm
and broke the marudam trees when Asurans came as those trees.
As Rama, he fought the Raksasas and burned Lanka.
He will give you moksha, the divine place where there is no sorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord shot his arrows and destroyed the seven marā trees,
and he took the form of a dwarf, went to Mahābali and took over the sky and the earth.
When Ravana, the king of Lanka took Sita, ornamented with beautiful jewels,
our lord, as Rama, went to southern Lanka. fought with Ravana and killed him
and brought his wife back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who slept on a banyan leaf on the ocean
as a magic child at the end of the eon
swallowed the earth and the flood of water.
O heart, worship the feet of him
adorned with a cool thulasi garland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord kicked Sakaṭasuran when he came as a cart,
went between the Marudu trees when the Asurans came as those trees,
breaking them and killing them,
and he took the form of a boar, split open the earth,
brought up the earth goddess and loved her.
The love that he has for Lakshmi
whom he embraces on his chest
is more than the love that he has for the earth goddess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord with lovely long eyes
like lotuses swarming with singing bees
wears many jewels on his large mountain-like chest
so it looks like a dark cloud glittering with lightning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We do not know
whether our god’s color is white, red, green or black.
If one thinks about it only Saraswathi, the goddess of art,
could equal the beauty of the god
who is the beloved of Lakshmi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With beautiful Lakshmi on his chest
he is like lightning shining in the dark sky.
People should understand that worshiping the feet of the dark god
who rides on Garuḍa is the only devotion they need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know that the god who asked for three feet of land from Mahābali
and took over the world and sky with his cleverness
stays happily in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where a female monkey tells her mate sitting on a small hill,
“Catch the white moon and give it to me.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found the way to survive
worshiping the feet of the dear lovely-eyed sapphire-colored lord
adorned with long thulasi garlands that make him look
like a dark mountain on which a waterfall flows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our god blew his conch and conquered his enemies on all battlefields,
protected the cows from the storm with Govardhana mountain,
went between the Marudam trees and destroyed them,
broke the cart when Sakaṭasuran came in that form,
drank the milk of the devil Putana
and threw the calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just as Thiruvenkaṭam, the milky ocean and Vaikuṇṭam
are ancient temples where the lord stays,
now Thirukkaḍigai surrounded with flourishing groves
swarming with bees is the divine heavenly place of the young lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who took three feet of land from Mahābali and measured the world
after receiving a promise from him with water poured on his hands
stays in Thiruviṇṇagaram, in Thiruvekka surrounded by ocean with rolling waves,
in Thiruvenkaṭam, in Maṇṇakaram, in Thiruveḷukkai filled with beautiful palaces,
in Thirukkuḍanthai in the south,
in sweet Thiruvarangam surrounded with groves dripping with honey
and in southern Thirukkoṭṭiyur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My father, the god of Thirumalai
where waterfalls flow with abundant water
has only one form that combines
Shiva with his long jaṭa, shining golden mazu,
and a snake around his neck
and our Thirumāl with a tall crown, a discus, and golden thread.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the snake Vasuki as a rope
and Mandara mountain as a churning stick
he churned the milky ocean,
took nectar from it and gave it to the gods.
Is he so tired because of that
that he reclines in Thiruvekka, sits in Kānji
and stands in Thiruvaragam?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our father who broke the tusks of the elephant
Kuvalayābeeḍam and killed it
went as a man-lion in the evening
and angrily split open the chest of Hiraṇyan
and protected Prahaladan, the son of Hiraṇyan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Asurans Madhu and Kaiḍava
were destroyed when Adisesha with jewels on his head
merely breathed on them.
If anyone becomes the enemy of the god
and their end will be like that of Madhu and Kaibadava.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lovely lotus on the navel of the lord
thinks that the shining discus in his right hand is the sun
and the white conch in his left is the moon
and, confused, opens and closes at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who threw the calf at the Vilam tree
and destroyed the Asurans
stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hills where a monkey
that plucks a fruit from a vilam tree,
sees his own shadow in the water of a spring,
thinks another monkey has his fruit
and extends his hands and asks the shadow monkey to give it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her mother says,
“My daughter sings the praise of Thiruvenkaṭam
whenever she thinks of any hills.
She wears thulasi on her dark hair thinking
that is the best thing for a chaste women to wear
and she goes to bathe in the large ocean every morning
thinking that it is the milky ocean
where broad-armed Thirumāl rests.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The elephant in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
who washes his teeth with his ichor,
washes his hands and legs with the water from the waterfalls,
and carries blooming flowers that drip honey
goes, sees and worships the heroic lord of Thiruvenkaṭam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who threw a calf at the vilam tree and killed the Asurans
stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where an elephant, thinking that a cloud is an enemy elephant,
runs and tries to fight it and a yāḷi, seeing the elephant,
screams in anger and kills the elephant
as the sound echoes through the hills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our young lord stays in Thiruvenkaṭam hill
where the bamboo sticks that gypsy girls
with round bangles throw as they play, rise up to the sky
and release the shining moon from its curse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the best thing for our tongues to praise him
who drove a chariot yoked to seven horses and danced on a pot.
To worship the feet ornamented with sounding anklets
of the god of Thiruvenkaṭam is a good thing for us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He drank the milk of the breasts of cruel devil Putana
and made her fall to the ground,
but the cowherdess Yasodha took him on her lap
and fed him milk, keeping him at her breasts.
Isn&rsquo;t her love beautiful?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the divine Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where the blossoms of vengai tree spread their fragrance,
an angry tiger sees the rabbit in the floating white moon
against the red color of the sky, thinks it is a real rabbit
and becomes angry because it could not catch it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2357">
<li>You do not need to stand on a hill,
plunge into water or stand near five sacrificial fires to reach him.
If you sprinkle flowers, folding your hands,
and lovingly worship the god of Thiruvekka,
all your bad karma will disappear.</li>
</ol>
<p>2358.The Raksasa Rāvaṇa who slept on the lap of Nānmuhan as a baby
and received boons from him, his grandfather,
carried a shining sword and fought with Rama,
and Rama cut off all his ten crowned heads
and made them all fall on the earth.
Rama&rsquo;s lotus feet are the refuge of us, his devotees.</p>
<ol start="2359">
<li>
<p>We should not think, “Where is our refuge?
Where can we go? Are we going to be born again and again?”
Praise and worship the heroic lord
who destroyed the strength of his enemies with his discus—
he is our only refuge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If devotees control their five senses
and keep in their minds
only the dark ocean-colored lord
with a fragrant thulasi garland on his chest
they will not be born again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart tries to approach the divine feet of the lord
resting on the snake Adisesha
with a shining discus that conquers all
and who fought with Vānāsuran, riding on a jeweled chariot
and cut off his thousand arms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my firm heart, even though it is difficult to think of him,
think and praise him without worrying.
He is in you and will not move from there.
Why are you unable to know him.?
Why do you do not feel him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to be aware of him it is hard
and it is impossible for you to see him
even if he enters your heart.
Where can I go to see the lord, the king
adorned with a cool thulasi garland swarming with bees
and dripping with honey?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though people praise Māyan saying
that he is sweet, no one can see him,
yet the sweet ankleted lord, stays inside your heart
who became a dwarf, went like a thief
and measured the earth and the sky at Mahābali’s sacrifice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People think of him and say,
“He is the meaning of the four Vedas
and he is in our hearts and we feel him,”
but who has seen the cool lotus-eyed Māyavan?
How could one describe him in their poems?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In their poetry, poets worship the lord,
describing the beauty of his form,
and the devotees hear them
and come to worship him in all his temples.
Even if the poets and the people of the world praise the beauty of the lord
who conquered the seven bulls to marry Nappinnai,
will their words be enough to praise his divine shining beauty?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful clouds that flash with lightning,
roaring with thunder, show the color of dear Neḍumāl,
and the dark sky where clouds float together
looks like his dark color also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O lord ornamented with shining jewels
and a cool thulasi garland strung with bunches of flowers
that swarm with bees,
your body blooms like a flower and shines like an emerald,
and the evening sky has your color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worship the golden ankleted feet of the lord
who is adorned with a cool thulasi garland dripping with honey.
If you do not have doubts, saying, “This is good, this is bad.”
you will not collect more karma in future
and your past karma will go away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who plays sweet music on his flute
is the god of Thiruvenkaṭam
where gypsies plant millet seeds in the fields
that grow along with bamboo that rises and touches the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Thirumāl, adorned with a beautiful thulasi garland,
grew tall and touched the rivers in the sky with his divine foot
at the sacrifice of Mahābali as his silambu and his anklets rattled,
his eight arms hurt as they extended in eight directions
because the space of the whole earth was not enough for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The young lord swallowed the earth at the end of the eon,
drank poisonous milk from the breasts of the devil Putanā,
and when Yasodha the cowherdess tied him with a rope
because he stole butter, even though it hurt him
he did not get upset and kept quiet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, worship the ankleted feet of the dark-colored Māyan,
the unborn, divine one who was raised by Nandan, the chief of the cowherds.
As Kaṇṇan he fought with Vānāsuran when Anurudhan took Usha
and cut off his thousand arms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirumāl swallowed all the worlds,
kept them in his stomach at the end of the eon
and slept on a banyan leaf as a baby on the flood.
Who knows what will happen to this world?
O heart! Keep the lord inside you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I light the lamp of knowing and feel him
in my heart and keep him there.
The Māyan, standing, sitting and lying in different temples,
entered my heart and stays there always.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O heart, worship his divine feet and praise Thirumāl
who went to Hiraṇyan in the evening as a man-lion
and split open his chest with his sharp claws
as his blood flew all over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the gods in the sky bow to him
their jewel-studded crowns
mark the lotus feet
of the beloved of Lakshmi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the gods
Nānmuhan who stays on a lotus on his navel,
Shiva with long matted hair,
and Indra, colored like a kānji flower,
ever be able to think of him in their hearts even for a moment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lord who is the snow-covered mountains,
the wide sky, the wind and light
killed the Asuran Kesi when he came as a horse and protected us.
He will save us from Yama when he comes to take us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our refuge is the feet of the god of Aṭṭapuyaharam
who fought and conquered all his enemies
and killed the murderous crocodile with his discus
when it caught the elephant Gajendra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dark cloud-colored lord with a discus is always our refuge.
Our lord with a tulasi garland on his mountain-like chest
has lovely lotus eyes that shine like lightning in a dark cloud
as he embraces Lakshmi who is on a flower dripping with honey.</p>
</li>
