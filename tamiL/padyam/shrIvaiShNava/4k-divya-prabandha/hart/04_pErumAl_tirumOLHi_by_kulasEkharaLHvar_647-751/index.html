  <p>When will I see my god, the lord of Thiruvarangam</p>
<ol start="647">
<li>
<p>When will the day come when my two eyes see
the dark god shining like a komalam jewel,
resting on his beautiful white shining bed, the king of snakes
with a thousand shining foreheads
that remove the darkness with their bright diamonds,
as the god’s feet are washed
by the clear water of the Ponni river flowing
in the Thiruppadi of Srirangam.
When will my two eyes see him and feel happy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
that I can praise wholeheartedly our god, Māyon,
decorated with fragrant garlands
and dark as a kāyām flower?
He stays in my mind like a pillar
and rests on the water in Srirangam
on the fiery snake that has a curving body
and a thousand heads that spit fire
and that looks like a canopy made of fresh flowers.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
when I can place flowers under his feet
and approach him with his devotees
as the good Nānmuhan with four faces
and eight beautiful eyes praises him with his four tongues?
Our dear lord shining like pure gold
keeps Nānmuhan on a lovely lotus on his navel
while he sleeps on the beautiful snake bed in Srirangam.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come when I fold my hands
and worship the ocean-colored lord,
sprinkling pure fresh flowers with my hands
for him who split open the beak of the bird?
He is strong as a bull among the cowherds,
the king of the gods in the sky,
and is sweet Tamil and Sanskrit poetry.
The lord who carried Govardhana mountain to save the cows
rests on a snake bed in Srirangam
where sages without attachment
praise him with their tongues.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
when I worship, bowing my head,
and see the dear sapphire-colored lord
decorated with garlands
resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
that is rich and filled with palaces and beautiful porches?
He is praised by Narada and the rishi Thumburu there ,
playing sweet matchless music on their yāzhs
and Nānmuhan, adorned with beautiful flowers,
worships him constantly with the incomparable ancient Vedas.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come when I worship
melting in my heart and see the divine face
bright as the moon and the lotus eyes of him
resting on the snake bed in beautiful Srirangam
surrounded by groves blooming with fragrant flowers?
Nānmuhan who stays on a beautiful lotus,
Shiva, Indira and all other gods, Apsarases
and wise sages join together and sprinkle flowers
in all the directions and worship him there.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
when my eyes, filled with tears,
see the dark-colored Māyon resting on the snake bed
in beautiful Srirangam on the Kaveri river?
He changes the evil hearts of people to good,
helps them control their five senses
and relieves them of the burden of their troubles and sickness,
making them his devotees
so they can follow the ways of dharma in their minds.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
when I who have done bad karma
can see and join happily the god
resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
surrounded by groves and flourishing fields where fish frolic?
He protects the world with his long bent bow, conch,
sword, his discus that destroys his enemies
and his vehicle Garuḍa that flies in the sky.
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
when I worship, jumping and rolling on the ground,
and see the dear lord with a discus
resting on the snake bed in Srirangam
where the beating of beautiful drums
is like the sound of the ocean
and devotees, joined together in a group
and loving the lord in their minds,
sing devotional songs,
shed tears like rain and praise him happily?
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When will the day come
when I see the group of happy devotees
and join them and am joyful
in the divine temple of beautiful Srirangam
where Thirumāl rests facing south
giving his grace so that the wide sky pours rain,
the gods in the heavens are saved,
the earth flourishes,
the people of the world survive,
the sorrow of people disappears,
good health increases in the world
and his devotees live happily?
When will I see him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kulasekaran, the king with a strong army
who carries a victorious shining sword
and sits under a royal umbrella,
composed ten Tamil pāsurams praising the lord of Srirangam
who rests on the snake bed on Ponni river.
If devotees learn these pāsurams well and recite them
they will stay under the feet of Nāraṇan
who showers goodness to all.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Lord of Southern Thiruvarangam.</p>
<ol start="658">
<li>
<p>If I am able to see and join
the happy group of true devotees
who call, sing and dance, enthralled,
and think only of Rangan of south Srirangam,
as sweet as honey, hard to find,
decorated with garlands that never wither,
with the goddess of wealth seated on his chest,
that will be the purpose of this birth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I can see and join the devotees
who praise him saying,
“O Ranga, you embrace Lakshmi,
seated on a lotus with blooming buds.
You cut down the tall mango tree with your shining sword
and you grazed the cows,”
and if I can think only of him and call him,
dance, sing and worship the dust on his devotees’ feet,
why should I desire to bathe in the Ganges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His devotees sing and praise him, saying,
“You conquered the bulls.
Taking the form of a boar you split the earth.
As Rāma you conquered your enemy Ravaṇan.
You came as a dwarf and measured the earth.”
When I see your devotees as they make the front yard
of Rangan’s temple wet with their tears
that are like the flow of abundant water of the rich Ponni river,
I will put on my head the good dust
that is beneath their divine feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart praises and worships the divine feet
of the devotees who call, worship, melt and praise him, saying,
“Nāraṇa, you are our dear god.
You were not afraid that Yashoda might punish you
when she saw you stealing and eating the butter,
good yogurt and milk.
You stood there bravely and tapped your arms in front of her.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has the color of a dark cloud
and carries a heroic bow.
He killed seven evil bulls, breaking their horns,
and he danced on the snake Kalingan.
My mind trembles
when I think of the devotees
whose bodies shake when they worship Rangan
of southern Srirangam
surrounded by strong shining stone walls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In all my births, my heart worships and praises
those devotees who love and serve Rangan
and wander everywhere to show
the faultless good path to sinners
who do not have devotion
and do not worship the divine feet of Thirumāl,
the lord without beginning or end,
the wonderful one, the dear god of the gods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart loves and praises
the feet of the devotees
who love Thirumāl and shed tears,
melting in their hearts as they worship him,
a bright wonderful light,
Rangan of Srirangam, with a red mouth,
teeth like pearls, a body dark as a cloud
and a chest decorated with Thulasi garlands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has lovely flower-like eyes
and his divine mountain-like chest
wears a fragrant thulasi garland
swarming with bees and dripping with honey
as he rests on the milky ocean.
My heart falls in love with those devotees
who are fascinated by him
and wander, sing, dance and worship Rangan, our dear lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The devotees of Rangan, my lord and father,
as they shed tears of joy,
tremble, long for him in their hearts
worship, dance and sing.
They seem mad but they are not.
It is those people who do not worship, dance, sing
and praise him who are truly mad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kulasekharan, the king of Uraiyur,
the lord of Kuḍal Nagar and the protector of Kolli hills
composed sweet Tamil pāsurams on Rangan,
the beloved of Lakshmi.
He abides in the minds of his true devotees
if they think only of him and serve him as his slaves.
If they learn and recite these pāsurams
they will become the devotees of his devotees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the people of this world
think that the false life on this earth is true.
I do not want to join them.
I call you, “O dear father, Ranga!”
and suffer falling in love with you, my Thirumāl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people of the world
love women with beautiful waists as thin as threads.
I do not want to join them.
I call you, saying, “O Ranga who sleep on the banyan leaf,
my love increases for you, the Thirumāl,
and I suffer with love for you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people of this world fall in love when Kāma shoots
his mischievous arrows from his beautiful bow.
I do not want to join them.
My Rangan’s chest is adorned with garlands
and he is my good Nāraṇan who rests on Adisesha.
He saves his devotees from falling into hell.
I am crazy for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people of this world
crave food and clothes and search for them.
I do not want to join them.
See, he drank milk from the breasts of the cruel devil Putanā,
and I am crazy for Rangan, the lord of the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not join with those who do evil things
when there are good things to do.
I am crazy for the ancient one, the cowherd, Rangan,
the beloved husband of innocent Lakshmi
seated on a beautiful lotus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will not join people
if they are not the devotees of the highest. .
I do not think the life of any other god in the sky is best.
For all my seven births I want to be a crazy devotee
of my dear god of the gods of divine Srirangam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mind shuns the thought of joining anyone
who is not your devotee.
I call you, “O Thirumāl with beautiful eyes,
you are my Rangan, you are my lord!”
and I become crazy for you, my beloved. .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone in the world looks crazy to me.
and I am also crazy.
I tell this to all and call you,
“O cowherd, Ranga!”
and I become crazy for you, my dear lord.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The king of Kongu country Kulasekharar
thinks only of the feet of him who rests on the ocean,
and he composed pāsurams about the devotees
who are crazy for the lord.
If devotees recite the words of Kulasekaran
they will have no troubles in their lives.
Lord of Thiruvenkaṭam hills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not want this body that is a bundle of flesh.
I want to be born as a kurugu bird that lives
on the branches of the trees in Thiruvenkaṭam
of him with a conch in his left hand
who conquered seven strong bulls.
I want only to be his slave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not want endless wealth or status,
I don’t want to be surrounded by heavenly women
or have the joy of ruling the sky
and a kingdom on the earth.
I want to be born as a fish in a spring
in Thiruvenkaṭam filled with groves
flourishing with flowers that drip honey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He carries a shining round discus.
Shiva with matted hair, Nanmuhan and Indra
could not enter the divine entrance of Vaikuṇṭam
even when they approached it,
but I will enter holding the golden plate
that the king of Thiruvenkaṭam ate from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Māyon rests on the cool milky ocean
where fertile coral-creepers float.
I would have the good fortune of blooming
as a shenbaga flower in Thiruvenkaṭam hills
where a swarm of bees sings and praises him.
I will see the feet of Māyon, decorated with anklets,
as he stays in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not want to sit
on the neck of a rutting elephant that frightens everyone

I want to have the good fortune
of standing as a pole in the beautiful Venkaṭam hills
of our beloved lord.</p>

<li>
<p>I do not want to enjoy
the dance and songs of heavenly women
like Urvasi and Menaka with waists as thin as lightning.
I want to have the good fortune of being a golden peak

where bees swarm and sing “tenna, tenna.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not want the luxury of sitting
under a white royal umbrella
bright as the moon that rules the sky.
I want to be a forest river that flows
from the Thiruvenkaṭam hills surrounded with groves
blooming with flowers that drip honey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to be a path on the Thiruvenkaṭam hills

when they performed sacrifices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O, Thirumāl, you take away the bad karma of all.
You are the highest ! You stay in the Thiruvenkaṭam hills.
Devotees, the gods in the sky and Apsarases
stand at the entrance of your temple to see you.
I will become a step at the threshold of your temple
and I will see your coral mouth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if I were to become the king
of the world of the gods,
rule it beneath a sole umbrella
and enjoy the waist of Urvasi,
decorated with beautiful golden ornaments,
I would not want it.
I want to become anything on the golden hills
of Thiruvenkaṭam of my lord. .</p>

<p>Kulasekharan with a sharp spear

Do not give me troubles—
I have no refuge but you.
I am like a crying child thinking of the love
of the mother who gave birth to it
even if she goes away when she is angry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A girl of a good family knows no one
except the husband who married her
even if he treats her so badly
that those who see hate him.
I am like her. You are my father,

surrounded by forts that touch the sky.
Even if you are like a husband and possess me,
I will praise only your feet decorated with sounding anklets.</p>

<p>You are my father, the god of Vitruvakkoṭṭam
surrounded by fertile fields where fish swim.
Even if you do not look at me,
I have no refuge except you.
I am like those who live depending on the rule
of a king decorated with garlands
even if, unconcerned, he causes them much pain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
a patient loves and does not leave a doctor
even when he cuts him with a knife and burns him.
I am like that patient. Even if you cause me pain
that I must bear, I am enthralled by you.
I am your slave and look only for your grace
and think you are my only friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my father, lord of Vitruvakkottam
who conquered the strong cruel-eyed elephant,
where can I go and be saved except beneath your feet?
I am like a huge bird that wanders
looking for the shore of the ocean with rolling waves
and, unable to find it, comes back
to the mast of a ship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are my father, the lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
where red lotuses bloom only under the hot sun
even though the sun comes to the middle of the sky
and burns them with its heat.
I am like those lotuses.
Even if you do not take away my bad karma,
my heart only melts for your endless grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
even when it has not rained for a long time,
the green crops look at the huge dark clouds
floating in the sky hoping it will rain.
I am like them. I am your slave.
Even if my troubles will not go away,
my heart will look only for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,
even if all the rivers come together
spread and flood everywhere,
they cannot stay where they are but must join the ocean.
I wish to join you as those rivers join the ocean.
O virtuous one who have the color of a dark shining cloud.
See, I have no way to find refuge
except to come to you for your grace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O my father, lord of Vitruvakkoṭṭam,

<p>Kaṇṇan and the cowherd girls.</p>
<ol start="698">
<li>
<p>“Many of the cowherd women in this town
decorated with fresh flowers
say they don’t want to embrace your chest
because you lied to them.
I am standing on a sand dune
on the bank of the Yamuna river
shaking in the cold that comes after a strong rain.
O Vasudeva, I am waiting for you to come.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You saw a lovely girl with beautiful fish-like eyes
churning yogurt in her home near you
and you entered her house like a thief and said,
‘I will also churn yogurt.’
When the girl with long beautiful hair
that was decorated with flowers swarming with bees
saw you, her bright face sweated and her red mouth quivered.
O Damodara, I know truly how you churn the yogurt!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You looked at one girl
with dark hair adorned with flowers,
you approached another girl and your heart fell for her,
you told another girl about her,
you told lies to another innocent girl,
and you embraced a curly-haired young girl,
but you are not true to any of them.
O you who destroyed the wrestlers
when they came as marudu trees,
as you grow, your magic grows with you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Even though there is nectar-like milk
in your mother’s breast, you crawled
and toddled to the devil Putanā,
put your mouth to her breasts
and drank her poisonous milk.
Those who saw you called you crazy.
I am here and I love you,
but you got together with the girl
I sent as a messenger and enjoyed her.
Is that also one of your naughty deeds?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I saw you wearing golden silk clothes
as you went on the street in the dark night
with another girl with a thin lightning-like waist.
I stood there and saw how you looked at her
as she looked at you,
but you were also gesturing with your hands
to call another girl who saw you.
Why have you left them all and returned?
Dear one, go back to them now.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“O Vasudeva with strong heroic arms,
did I do something to get bad karma?
When I went to rest in the middle of the night,
you left me on the bed alone,
and not only that night, my dear one,
but other nights also.
And after you embraced young girls,
you came back to me.
Why did you come back and leave them?
O dear one, get up and go to them.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“O you who rest on the snake bed of Adishesha,
we are not like the ones you knew before,
not like those you loved
with beautiful eyes darkened with kohl.
Stop coming to our village and staying here.
It is enough that we fell for you,
looking at your beautiful clothes, divine face,
fruit-like red lips and listening to the music of your flute.
If we hear your lies for one day, that is enough.
Stop saying your cheating words to attract us.
O young one, please go away.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You asked me to come here
but you went to the pandal blooming
with clusters of jasmine and loved her.
When you saw me, you muttered
as if your heart was melting for me.
Even though you brought a golden dress for me
and lied that you love me before you went away,
when you come to see me again
I will still care for you,
and if I see you my anger may go away.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Your chest is decorated
with lovely, auspicious flower garlands
and you wear peacock feathers in your hair.
Your bright clothes are beautiful
and your ears are adorned with a bunch of flowers.
You played sweet music on the flute for the girls,
with hair adorned with fragrant kongu flowers
and flirted with them.
Would you come and play music
on your flute one day to enthrall us”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kulasekharan, the chief of Kolli hills

<p>Devaki&rsquo;s Lullaby to Krishna.</p>
<ol start="708">
<li>
<p>“You are as sweet as the sugarcane juice
that comes from a sugarcane press, thālo.
Your big eyes are lovely as lotuses in the water, thālo.
Your color is like the water of the ocean, thālo.
You are the king who killed the elephant Kuvalayābeeḍam, thālo.
You are my son with handsome fragrant hair, thālo.
I am more unlucky than all other mothers
because I don’t have the good fortune
of singing a lullaby and saying “thālo, thālo” for you.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Your lotus eyes darkened with kohl are beautiful
as you look up and see the decorations on the cradle.
You look like a baby cloud.
As you bend your legs and put your fingers in your mouth,
you look like an elephant bending its trunk and sleeping.
O Kesava, I don’t have the good fortune
of seeing these things when you are a baby.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Mothers from good families
keep their children on their laps and say,
‘You are my dear one,
you are the bright light of our family,
you are like a bull that has the color of a cloud.’
When someone asked you, ‘Who is your father?’
you looked at Nandagopan out of the corner of your eyes
and pointed at him with your beautiful fingers.
Vasudevan, our chief, does not have the good fortune
of being your father.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“O Kaṇṇa, your face is like the shining full moon,
your hands, chest and arms are strong,
your dark hair is adorned with fresh flowers,
your forehead is like the crescent moon
and your eyes are like lotuses blooming in a pond.
I do not have the fortune of seeing
you with my eyes when you are a baby
even though I think of myself as your mother.
I am unlucky and I don’t have the pleasure
of raising my child, yet still I am alive.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You kissed your father Nandagopan
and your mother Yashoda with your beautiful lips
as the chuṭṭi ornament on your beautiful forehead swung around.
You put your sweet fingers into your lovely mouth
and prattled innocently.
When your father saw you like that
his heart was filled with joy,
but I did not have the good fortune of seeing those things
or listening to your baby talk.
Only the divine Yashoda has known that joy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“O Kaṇṇa with cool lotus eyes,
you crawled and toddled in the cowherd village
and you played in the red sand.
I don’t have the good fortune of embracing you
and covering my chest with the red sand you played in.
When you eat your food you scatter it all over.
I never had the good fortune of eating
what was left over on your plate.
Surely, my karma is bad.
What is the use of my mother gave birth to me?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“O sweet one, my lovely child, Govinda,
babies hold on to one of their mothers’ breasts
with their young beautiful hands
that are as tender as shoots and drink milk.
They look at their mother’s face and smile at them.
I don’t have the fortune of feeding you milk like that.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You took butter with your small lotus-bud-like hands and ate it.
When Yashoda brought a rope you were afraid she was going to hit you
and, your beautiful mouth smeared with yogurt,
you were scared as you looked at her and cried
and your small red mouth trembled.
Then you folded your hands and worshipped her
and when she saw this, she found endless joy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You stopped the rain with Govardhana mountain
and protected the cows.
You danced the beautiful kuravai dance
and danced on a pot.
You picked up the Rakshasas when they came as calves,
threw them at the vilam fruit tree and killed them.
You danced on the head of Kalingan the snake.
I never saw how you played like this as a child—
my heart never felt the joy of seeing these things.
Give me your grace that I may see you play like that
if you can do it again.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“When you drank milk from the breasts of Putanā,
the evil-hearted one, her body became withered,
blood flowed out and her nerves were broken.
You survived even though you drank her poisonous milk
and gave your grace to all.
O my father who are like a dark cloud,
who took the life of Kamsan,
my breasts are a burden to me and I cannot use them.
I think I will see you one day
and that is the only thing I am living for.
You have a good mother, Yashoda.”</p>

<p>Kulasekharan the king of Kolli
who bowed down with his head and worshiped Kaṇṇan

<p>The story of Rāma—Dasharatha suffers when Rama goes to forest.</p>
<ol start="730">
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “You were going to become king
as the people of this flourishing country
bowed to your strong feet and worshipped you.
When you were about to sit on the throne,
O Rāma, your step-mother said,
‘Go and stay for a long time in the large forest.’
I listened to the words of Kaikeyi, your mother,
and asked you to go to the forest.
O my dear son, that is what I did to you!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “You listened to my cruel words
and left quickly, leaving this kingdom
with its victorious elephants, chariots and horses
and went to the forest.
Your lovely wife, decorated with ornaments,
her long eyes like spears smeared with oil,
and your younger brother Lakshmana followed you.
How could you walk in that cruel forest?
O our Rāma! You are my dear lord.
What can I do?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “You, with your mountain-like arms that can fight anyone,
the son of the family of Kosalai
whose long red-lined eyes are like murderous spears,
know how to melt my heart.
Before you slept on a soft bed in the palace—
how are you going to sleep
under the shadow of a tree in the large forest?
How could you learn to sleep on a stone bed,
O dark king of the dynasty of Kahustha?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “Come here and go back to the forest,
come and see me one more time before you go.
O you who broke the bow of Shiva who rides the bull
to marry your wife Sita
with lovely hair decorated with flowers
and beautiful bamboo-like arms.
Now you are going to the wide forest
and you make my heart suffer.
Surely I must have done bad karma.
My son, you are leaving,
yet my heart does not split in two.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “Your soft feet will hurt
when you walk on the gravel with stones
as sharp as the points of the spears enemies hold,
and they may bleed.
Willingly you are going to the forest
where no one wishes to go.
The sun will be hot and hunger will cause you cruel pain.
My son, you are going now
because I, a sinner, listened to the evil daughter of king Kaikeyan.
Surely I must have done bad karma. What can I do to stop you?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “From now on
I will not hear anyone lovingly calling me “amma.”
No more will I feel the tight embrace
of his ornamented chest on my chest.
I cannot kiss him on his forehead,
I will not be able to see his majestic walk
that is like the stride of an elephant,
I will not be able to see his lotus face anymore.
I have lost my dear one, my son.
Surely I have done terrible deeds, yet I am still alive.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “His hair that was decorated
with fragrant flowers is matted into jaṭa now.
He would wear lovely, soft garments on his waist
but now he wears orange clothes like a renunciant
and he does not wear any ornaments.
Is it right that my son with such handsome arms
should go to the forest instead of me?
O, Sumanthra, O sage Vashisṭa,
you are learned men of the Vedas. Tell me!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “O Kaikeyi,
you have sent to the forest my divine son, as precious as gold,
his brother Lakshmaṇa and my gentle-natured daughter-in-law
with a waist as thin as lightning
and words as sweet as a puvai bird’s.
People will blame your own son Bharatha
for what you have done
and you are going to make me go to heaven in the sky.
What are you going to get from all this?
O Kaikeyi, how could you live happily in this large world?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “You broke the bow
of axe-carrying Parasurāma and destroyed his tapas.
Without thinking how I will suffer
and without thinking how your mother will suffer,
you just listened to my words
and my promise to your step-mother
and left for the forest.
You are my dear one.
I wish that you could be born as my son
for the next seven births.
May I have that fortune,
O king with long, strong arms.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dasaratha says, “I heard the cruel words
of the evil Kaikeyi who followed the advice of Kuni
and now I will leave Sumithra to suffer
and Kosalai with hair filled with flowers that drip honey.
You are going to the forest, leaving this rich palace happily,
and I will leave this place
and go to the gods’ world happily,
O king of the dynasty of Manu.”</p>

<p>Dasharatha, adorned with garlands,
his arms strong as mountains, suffered when his son,
the beautiful dark Neḍumāl, went to the forest.

learned in all the mantras and the Vedas
shot a strong arrow and split open the chest of Thaḍagai

See, our dear god stays in the Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai,
surrounded with cool flourishing groves
blooming with flowers with green tender leaves,
as he sits on a throne studded with diamonds,
praised by three thousand Andaṇars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To marry Sita whose long dark lovely eyes were lined with red,
the heroic Rāma who conquered kings with sharp spears,
broke the bow of Shiva, the angry bull rider carrying a mazhu weapon.
He stays in divine Chithrakuḍam in Thillai surrounded by tall walls.
I worship the feet of the worshipers of Rāma
whose cruel bow conquers his mighty enemies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Rāma he left his kingdom, obeying the words of Kaikeyi
whose curly hair was decorated with bunches of fresh flowers,
went to the forest,
crossed the Ganges with the help of Guhan, his dear devotee,
and gave his sandals and his kingdom to Bharathan
when his brother came to see him.
He stays in beautiful Chithrakuḍam in Thillai.
If devotees see him happily with their two eyes,
they will be equal to the gods in the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Rāma he killed the Rakshasa Virāḍan
with strong mountain-like arms,
received a bow from the sage Agasthya, creator of rich Tamil,
cut off the nose of the beautiful Rakshasi Surpanakha,
took the lives of Karan and Dushanan,
and bent his bow and shot arrows to kill the Raksasa Mārisan
when he came as a golden deer.
He stays in Chithrakuḍam in Thillai
and this earth is fortunate that his devotees wander there
bowing their heads and worshiping him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Rāma he was separated from Vaidehi, his lovely wife.
He was sad when Jaṭāyu was killed by Ravanan and sent to Vaikuṇṭam,
he became friends with the king of monkeys&rsquo; Sugrivan
and he killed Vali in the Kishkinda forest,
relieving the suffering of Sugrivan.
He made Hanuman burn Lanka
ruled by Ravaṇan, the king of the Rakshasas,
so that Hanuman’s anger would abate.
I worship the feet of the devotees of Rāma,
the dear god who stays happily in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Rāma he shot his arrows to calm the stormy ocean,
made a bridge with the help of the monkeys
and reached Lanka on the other side of the sea.
He killed the Rakshasas who carried strong long spears,
took the life of Ravaṇa the king of Lanka
and gave the kingdom to Ravaṇa’s brother Vibhishaṇa,
and returning to Ayodhya with his wife as lovely as Lakshmi,
he was seated on his throne.
I will not consider anyone my king
except Rāma the god of Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rāma who reached Ayodhya filled with gold
and beautiful diamond-studded palaces,
heard his own story
from the mouths, red as coral, of his two sons
born to Sita, the princess of Mithila, to save the world.
If we hear and drink in the story of Rāma

because he saved his son.
His brother Laksmaṇa killed the Rakshasa Ilavaṇan

we will not have any trouble in our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the dear lord adorned with garlands
returned from the forest, the gods in the sky welcomed him.
By the grace of him who fought with the strong Asuras
and conquered them
all people and creatures in the world go to Vaikuṇṭam.
He stays always in Thiruchithrakuḍam in Thillai.
O devotees of Rāma, praise him saying, “avan ivan!”
and worship him always.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kulasekharan, the king of Uṛaiyur,
who rules under a royal umbrella
and carries a victorious shining sword
composed a garland of ten Tamil pāsurams
describing the endless fame of Rāma,
the son of Dasharatha and the friend of Hanumān.
If devotees know and recite these ten sweet Tamil pāsurams
they will approach the feet of Nāraṇan who shines with goodness.</p>
