~90% of UP vocabulary comes from Sanskrit-Prakrit:  

- tatsama 25%
- tadbhava 50%
- deshaja 15%

The rest 10% are loan words, most of which modified to indigenize.

The number 90% is the estimate of a scholar who studied UP’s speech. 


As per Urdu lexicographers like Rauf Parekh and Syed Ahmed Dehlavi, 99% of Urdu verbs and 75% of Urdu words come from Sanskrit and Prakrit.
