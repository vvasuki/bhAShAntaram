      <description>Latin as She is Spoke: How Classicists Tricked Themselves, and the Real Issue with Mary Beard&amp;rsquo;s Latin
Source
A.Z. Foreman is a translator and poet who has been obsessed with languages and literature since childhood
Not long ago, Mary Beard graced us with a bit of honorable honesty in the Times Literary Supplement, in which she confessed to what is a bit of an open secret among most classicists. She can&amp;rsquo;t sight-read a complex Latin text all that well.</description>

Length ă - it’s called a breve, it marks a short a ā - a macron marks a long a, two matras long The dictionary (LSJ) in particular doesnt mark final and initial shorts - angărĭa is actually ăngărĭă. They assume you know that final /a/ is always short unless specified. Post medieval latin doesnt mark macrons. However, all modern textbooks that teach latin mark macrons. Greek orthography is much more conservative here, they always mark pitch accent (udatta, anudatta etc).</description>
